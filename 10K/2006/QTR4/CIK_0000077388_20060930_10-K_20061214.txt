      INFORMATION  

This
      document contains statements that may be considered forward-looking, such as:
      management's expectations and outlook for earnings, the statements of the
      Company's business and financial goals regarding its business segments, the
      effect of weather on net income, cash position, source of funds and financing

                of the
                Company's subsidiaries, or adverse decisions by the Commission with

                risks. 

Also,
      projections to future periods of the effectiveness of internal control over

PART
      I  

ITEM
      1.
      Business  

GENERAL  

Peoples
      Energy is a holding company and does not engage directly in any business of
      its
      own, but does provide administrative services that support the business
      activities of its subsidiaries. Income is derived principally from the Company s
      regulated utility subsidiaries, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The Company
      also derives income from its other subsidiaries, Peoples Energy Resources
      Company, LLC (Peoples Energy Resources), Peoples Energy Services Corporation
      (Peoples Energy Services) and Peoples Energy Production Company (Peoples Energy
      Production). The Company and its subsidiaries had 2,223 employees at September
      30, 2006. 

The
      Company was incorporated in 1967 under the Illinois Business Corporation Act
      and
      has its principal executive offices at 130 East Randolph Drive, Chicago,
      Illinois 60601-6207 (Telephone (312) 240-4000). 

The
      Company has five reportable business segments: Gas Distribution, Oil and Gas
      Production, Energy Marketing, Energy Assets, and Corporate and Other. (See
      Note
      3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information
      about the Company s business segments for the last three fiscal years.) Also see
      Note 2B of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial
      information about discontinued operations. 

MERGER  

On  
      July 8,
      2006, WPS Resources Corporation (WPS Resources), Wedge Acquisition Corporation
      (Sub), a wholly owned subsidiary of WPS Resources, and Peoples Energy
      Corporation (the Company or Peoples Energy) entered into an Agreement and Plan
      of Merger (the Agreement). 

The
      Agreement provides for the merger of Sub with and into Peoples Energy (the
      Merger) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement,
      with Peoples Energy continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of
      the
      Merger, Peoples Energy will become a wholly owned subsidiary of WPS Resources,
      and Peoples Energy shareholders will receive shares of WPS Resources common
      stock in exchange for their shares of common stock of Peoples Energy. At the
      effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Peoples Energy
      issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled
      and converted into the right to receive 0.825 shares of common stock of WPS
      Resources. The companies expect that upon consummation of the Merger Peoples
      Energy shareholders will own approximately 42.4% of the common stock of WPS
      Resources and WPS Resources shareholders will own approximately 57.6% of the
      common stock of WPS Resources.  

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy have each made customary representations,
      warranties and covenants in the Agreement, including, among others, covenants
      to
      conduct their businesses in the ordinary course between the execution of the
      Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and covenants not to engage in
      certain kinds of transactions during that period. During such period, Peoples
      Energy will not declare cash dividends in excess of $0.545 per share per quarter
      without the prior consent of WPS Resources. Immediately after the effective
      time
      of the Merger, WPS Resources will adopt a dividend policy providing for a
      quarterly dividend of $0.66 per share of WPS Resources common stock, subject
      to
      evaluation over time as future business needs dictate. WPS Resources and Peoples
      Energy have made certain additional customary covenants, including, among
      others, covenants, subject to certain exceptions, (A) to cause a shareholders
      meeting to be held to consider approval of the Merger and the other transactions
      contemplated by the Agreement, (B) not to solicit proposals relating to
      alternative business combination transactions, and (C) not to enter into
      discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with,
      alternative business combination transactions.

          - 

Consummation
      of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, among others,
      (i)
      approval of the shareholders of each of WPS Resources and Peoples Energy, (ii)
      absence of any material adverse effect, (iii) expiration or termination of
      the
      applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, (iv) absence of any order
      or
      injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (v) the registration
      statement on Form S-4 shall have become effective, (vi) the shares of WPS
      Resources common stock issuable to Peoples Energy s shareholders pursuant to the
      Agreement and under the employee benefit plans of Peoples Energy shall have
      been
      approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, (vii) subject to certain
      exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to
      WPS
      Resources  and Peoples Energy s business, as applicable, (vii) receipt of
      customary tax opinions and (viii) receipt of all required statutory approvals
      from, among others, the FERC, the Federal Communications Commission, and state
      public service and utility commissions.  

The
      Agreement contains certain termination rights for both WPS Resources and Peoples
      Energy, and further provides that, upon termination of the Agreement under
      specified circumstances, a party would be required to pay the other party a
      termination fee of $45 million. In addition, under specified circumstances
      each
      party may be obligated to reimburse the other party for up to $15 million of
      expenses, which would reduce the amount of any required termination fee payable
      by that party. 

The
      consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing
      conditions applicable to both WPS   Resources
      and Peoples Energy, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals
      and
      the approval of the transaction by the shareholders of both WPS Resources and
      Peoples Energy. On August 2, 2006, WPS Resources, Peoples Energy, Peoples Gas
      and North Shore Gas jointly filed an application for approval of the Merger
      with
      the Commission. The companies seek the expedited consideration of the
      application by the Commission, with requested approval by December 28, 2006
      so
      that the Merger could close on or shortly after January 1, 2007. The application
      indicates that The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company (Peoples Gas) and North
      Shore Gas Company (North Shore Gas) will further postpone filing rate cases
      until early 2007, with new rates to take effect in 2008 due to the normal
      11-month rate case process in Illinois. On October 31, 2006, Commission Staff
      and Interveners filed Direct Testimony and opinion on the Merger proposal.
      On
      November 13, 2006, the Companies filed rebuttal testimony.  

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy filed their joint application for FERC approval
      on
      August 15, 2006. The comment period on the FERC filing passed with no comments
      received. On November 2, 2006, the FERC issued a deficiency letter identifying
      an item about which additional information was required, and WPS Resources
      and
      Peoples Energy responded on November 6, 2006. The comment period for this
      response was concluded on November 13, 2006. No comments were
      received. 

On
      August
      15, 2006, WPS Resources filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
      (PSCW) for approval of amendments to its  affiliated interest  agreements so
      that they include and apply to Peoples Energy and its subsidiaries, as
      appropriate, upon closing of the merger. These agreements govern the provision
      by and among WPS Resources and its regulated and non-regulated subsidiaries
      of
      services, property, and other things of value. Modification of these agreements
      requires the approval of the PSCW. WPS Resources had concluded that no other
      PSCW approvals were required prior to the closing of the merger. However, on
      August 9, 2006, the PSCW issued a notice of investigation of the merger to
      consider, among other things, whether the PSCW has jurisdiction and pre-approval
      authority over the merger. Subsequently, the PSCW asserted jurisdiction and
      pre-approval authority over the merger, and, on September 27, 2006, the PSCW
      re-noticed the investigatory matter as a contested case proceeding in which
      it
      would consider whether the merger is in the public interest and whether certain
      conditions should be placed upon WPS Resources (and affiliate arrangements
      within its holding company system) as a result of the merger. WPS Resources
      acknowledges the PSCW s continuing jurisdiction from time to time to consider
      and, if appropriate, impose additional conditions upon Wisconsin public utility
      holding companies. However, WPS Resources does not believe that the PSCW has
      jurisdiction and pre-approval authority over the merger, even though the PSCW
      has asserted such jurisdiction and authority. The PSCW has established a
      schedule for completion of the proceeding that would accommodate a closing
      of
      the merger in the first quarter of 2007. WPS Resources  participation in the
      proceeding will be subject to its right to challenge the PSCW s asserted
      jurisdiction before the PSCW and on appeal of an adverse PSCW
      order.

Pursuant
      to the Agreement, management from both companies jointly selected Integrys
      Energy Group, Inc. (Integrys) as the new name for the combined company. Upon
      consummation of the Merger, WPS Resources  Board of Directors will be comprised
      of sixteen directors, nine of whom will have been designated by WPS Resources
      and seven of whom will have been designated by Peoples Energy. Mr. Larry Weyers,
      currently Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of WPS Resources,
      will
      remain President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys following the Merger.
      Mr. James Boris, currently the Lead Director of Peoples Energy will become
      the
      non-executive Chairman of Integrys as of the effective time of the Merger.
      Upon
      the consummation of the Merger, WPS Resources will amend bylaws consistent
      with
      the foregoing. 

On
      October 9, 2006, the Company identified many of Integrys  senior leaders, who
      will manage Integrys after the transaction closes through a holding company,
      operating companies and a services group. Following the Merger, Integrys will
      establish its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. The headquarters of the
      Integrys  unregulated energy marketing business will be located in Green Bay,
      Wisconsin and the headquarters of the utilities  businesses will be located in
      the same place as immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. The
      headquarters of the oil and gas production business will remain in Houston,
      Texas.  

On
      October 18, 2006, the WPS Resources registration statement on Form S-4 was
      made
      effective by the SEC.   On
      October 25, 2006, the Federal Trade Commission granted termination of the
      waiting period for the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing for the Merger. 

On
      December 6, 2006, at special meetings of shareholders held by WPS Resources
      and Peoples Energy, shareholders of both companies approved the proposed
      merger transaction. WPS Resources  shareholders also approved an amendment to
      WPS Resources Corporation s restated articles of incorporation to change the
      name of WPS Resources Corporation to Integrys Energy Group, Inc., when the
      closing of the merger has been completed.

      GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT  

Principal
      Products and Markets   

      The
      Gas
      Distribution segment is the Company s core business. Its two regulated utilities
      (Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, whose operations are limited to this segment
      and the Corporate and Other segment) purchase, store, distribute, sell and
      transport natural gas to approximately one million customers through an
      approximately 6,000-mile distribution-mains system serving Chicago and 54
      communities in northeastern Illinois. The customer base includes residential,
      commercial and industrial sales and transportation accounts that provide a
      broad
      and diversified foundation for the utilities  business. 

As
      part
      of this segment, Peoples Gas utilizes its storage and pipeline supply assets
      as
      a natural gas hub. This activity is regulated by the FERC and consists of
      providing wholesale transportation and storage services in interstate
      commerce. 

For
      fiscal 2006 and on September 30, 2006, the Gas Distribution segment accounted
      for   64%
      of
      revenues and 75% of capital assets. 

Peoples
      Gas was formed in 1855 and had 1,520 employees at September 30, 2006, of which
      883 are union employees. It has approximately 815,000 residential, commercial
      and industrial retail sales and transportation customers in
      Chicago. 

North
      Shore Gas was formed in 1900 and had 205 employees at September 30, 2006, of
      which 138 are union employees. It has approximately 156,000 residential,
      commercial and industrial retail sales and transportation customers within
      its
      service area of approximately 275 square miles, located in northeastern
      Illinois. 

-
          10
          - 

The
      basic
      marketing plans of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are to maintain their
      existing shares in traditional market segments, which include space heating,
      water heating, clothes drying and cooking. North Shore Gas  service territory
      has potential for expansion through increasing population density. 

Competition   

      Competition
      in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other fuels or forms of energy
      available to consumers in the Midwest and the utilities  respective service
      territories, such as electricity and diesel fuel. 

Absent
      extraordinary circumstances, potential competitors are barred from constructing
      competing gas distribution systems in the utility subsidiaries  service
      territories by a judicial doctrine known as the  first in the field  doctrine.
      In addition, the high cost of installing duplicate distribution facilities
      would
      render the construction of a competing system impractical. 

An
      interstate pipeline may seek to provide transportation service directly to
      end
      users. Such direct service by a pipeline to an end user would bypass the local
      distributor s service and reduce the distributor s earnings. No Peoples Gas
      customers have been lost to bypass service; only one end user in North Shore
      Gas  service territory is served directly by a pipeline supplier. Both utility
      subsidiaries have a bypass rate approved by the Commission, which allows the
      utilities to negotiate rates with customers that are potential bypass
      candidates. 

Since
      2002, all customers have had the opportunity to choose a gas supplier. A
      substantial portion of the gas that Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas deliver
      to
      their customers consists of gas that the subsidiaries  customers purchase
      directly from producers and marketers rather than from the utilities. These
      direct customer purchases have little effect on net income because the utilities
      provide transportation service for such gas volumes and recover margins similar
      to those applicable to conventional gas sales. 

Current
      Sources and Availability of Natural Gas   

      Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas have each entered into long-term and short-term firm
      gas
      supply contracts with various suppliers, including BP Canada Energy Marketing
      Corp., Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc., Oneok Energy Services Company, L.P.,
      and Tenaska Marketing Ventures, with remaining gas supply contract terms up
      to
      two years. When used in conjunction with contract storage, company-owned storage
      and peak-shaving facilities, such supply is deemed sufficient to meet current
      and foreseeable peak and annual market requirements. Although the Company
      believes North American gas supply to be sufficient to meet current and
      prospective United States market demands, it is unable to quantify or otherwise
      make specific representations regarding national supply availability and the
      cost of the supply. 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas purchase firm transportation and storage services from
      interstate pipelines in the ordinary course of business. Seven interstate
      pipelines interconnect with Peoples Gas  utility system and two interstate
      pipelines and one local distribution company interconnect with North Shore
      Gas 
utility system. Having multiple pipelines that serve the utilities  service
      territories improves reliability, provides access to diverse supply and fosters
      competition among these service providers that can lead to favorable conditions
      for the utilities when negotiating new agreements.

          11
          - 

The
      following table shows the expected design peak-day availability of gas in MDth
      during the 2006-2007 heating season for Peoples Gas and North Shore
      Gas: 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas forecast maximum peak day demands of 2,257 MDth and
      427
      MDth, respectively.  

The
      sources of gas supply (including gas transported for customers) in MDth for
      Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were as follows:  

Importance
      of Regulatory Environment   

Legislation
      and Regulation at State Level.    
      Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas are subject to the jurisdiction of and regulation by
      the
      Commission, which has general supervisory and regulatory powers over practically
      all phases of the public utility business in Illinois. These include rates
      and
      charges, issuance of securities, services and facilities, systems of accounts,
      investments, safety standards, transactions with affiliated interests and other
      matters. 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas are authorized, by statute and/or certificates of public
      convenience and necessity, to conduct operations in the territories they serve.
      In addition, these subsidiaries operate under franchises and license agreements
      granted to them by the municipalities they serve. Peoples Gas holds a perpetual,
      nonexclusive franchise to serve Chicago. North Shore Gas  franchises with
      municipalities within its service territory are of various terms and expiration
      dates. 

Impact
      on Sales and Rates.    
      Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas sell and distribute natural gas having an average
      heating value of approximately 1,000 Btu per cubic foot. Sales are made and
      service rendered by Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas pursuant to rate schedules
      on file with the Commission containing various service  

-
          12
          - 

classifications
      largely reflecting customers  different uses and levels of consumption. In
      addition to the rate for distribution of gas, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas
      each bills a gas charge representing the cost of gas and transportation and
      storage services purchased. This gas charge is determined in accordance with
      a
      rider to the rate schedules (Rider 2, Gas Charge) to recover the costs incurred
      by Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas to purchase, transport and store gas
      supplies. The level of the Gas Charge under both subsidiaries  rate schedules is
      adjusted monthly to reflect increases or decreases in natural gas supplier
      charges, gains, losses and costs incurred under its hedging program, purchased
      storage service costs, transportation charges and liquefied petroleum gas costs.
      In addition, under the tariffs of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, the
      difference for any month between costs recoverable through the Gas Charge and
      revenues billed to customers under the Gas Charge is refundable to or
      recoverable from customers. (See Notes 2K and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements.) 

Commission
      rules place restrictions on when the utility subsidiaries may terminate or
      deny
      service to customers who do not pay their bills for utility service. Though
      each
      utility s current rates were established to recover an estimated bad debt
      expense, bad debt expense can exceed these estimates by significant amounts,
      particularly for Peoples Gas. Both the federal and state governments have
      legislation that provides for additional funding for assistance to low-income
      energy users, including customers of the Company s utility subsidiaries. The
      state legislation creates a fund, financed by charges to electric and gas
      customers of public utilities, participating municipal utilities and electric
      co-ops, which supplements currently available federal energy
      assistance. 

Legislation
      and Regulation at Federal Level.    
      The
      Company is a holding company as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company
      Act of 1935 (1935 Act). By Order entered on December 6, 1968 (Holding Company
      Act Release No. 16233), the SEC, pursuant to Section 3(a)(1) of the 1935 Act,
      exempted the Company and its subsidiary companies as such from the provisions
      of
      the 1935 Act, other than Section 9(a)(2) thereof. 

The
      Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Policy Act), signed into law on August 8,
      2005, repeals the 1935 Act and makes clear the authority of the FERC over
      mergers or acquisitions of public utility holding companies. In addition, the
      Energy Policy Act reduces the depreciable life of certain gas distribution
      lines
      for Federal income tax purposes from twenty years to 15 years, and authorizes
      funding of coal gasification projects, which could provide additional gas
      supply.  

Most
      of
      the gas distributed by Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas is transported to the
      utilities  distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines  services
      (transportation and storage service) are regulated by the FERC under the Natural
      Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. (See Impact on Sales and Rates
      and Current Sources and Availability of Natural Gas.) 

Under
      United States Department of Transportation regulations, the Commission is
      responsible for monitoring Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas  safety compliance
      program for its pipelines under 49 CFR Part 192 (Transportation of Natural
      and
      Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards) and 49 CFR Part 195
      (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline). 

The
      Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 makes numerous changes to pipeline
      safety law, the most significant of which is the requirement that operators
      of
      pipeline facilities implement written integrity management programs. Such
      programs must include a baseline integrity assessment of an operator s
      transmission facilities that must be completed within 10 years after enactment
      of the legislation. Peoples Gas owns and operates 158 miles of pipelines subject
      to this requirement, and North Shore Gas owns and operates 96 miles of pipelines
      subject to this requirement. Implementation of this legislation is not expected
      to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations
      of
      the Company. 

Seasonality   

      The
      business of the Company s utility subsidiaries is influenced by seasonal weather
      conditions because a large element of the subsidiaries  customer load consists
      of space heating. Therefore, weather-related deliveries can have a significant
      positive or negative impact on net income. (For discussion of the Company s
      prior weather

          - 

insurance
      arrangements mitigating the effect of the seasonal nature of gas revenues on
      cash flow, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
      Risk Risk Management Activities Weather Risk.) 

During
      fiscal 2006, the Gas Distribution segment recorded 74% of its revenues from
      November through March. 

Practices
      Relating to Working Capital   

      The
      seasonality of revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated
      from January through June. A portion of the winter gas supply needs is typically
      purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending
      on the Gas Distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November.
      Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is likely
      to
      be supplemented with temporary increases of short-term commercial paper and
      bank
      loans during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced
      over
      the January through June period. 

Effects
      of Environmental Legislation   

      The
      Company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state environmental
      laws. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are conducting environmental
      investigations and remedial work at the sites of former manufactured gas plant
      operations. (See Note 7A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
      In
      1994, North Shore Gas received a demand for payment of environmental response
      costs at a former mineral processing site in Denver, Colorado (Denver Site).
      North Shore Gas does not believe that it has liability for the response costs
      but cannot determine the matter with certainty. (See Note 7B of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas did not incur and do not anticipate any material
      expenditures to construct environmental control facilities due to normal
      operations. 

2.
      OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION SEGMENT  

      The
      Oil
      and Gas Production segment, through Peoples Energy Production, is active in
      the
      acquisition, development and production of oil and gas reserves in selected
      onshore basins in the United States through direct ownership in oil, gas and
      mineral leases.   Peoples
      Energy Production s primary focus is on natural gas, with growth coming from low
      to moderate risk drilling opportunities and acquisition of proved reserves
      with
      upside potential that can be realized through drilling, production enhancements
      and reservoir optimization programs. Peoples Energy Production also has a 23%
      equity interest in EnerVest Energy, L.P. (EnerVest), which developed and managed
      a portfolio of oil and gas producing properties. This partnership closed a
      transaction on October 31, 2005 that resulted in the remaining properties owned
      by the partnership being sold to a third party. A substantial portion of the
      proceeds from the sale of assets have been distributed to the partners. The
      partnership is in the process of winding up the affairs of the partnership.
      Peoples Energy Production has no remaining capital investment commitments
      associated with the EnerVest partnership. 

Competition
      in acquiring oil and gas leases and producing properties in the Company s
      targeted onshore basins is substantial. Competitors include the major oil
      companies, as well as many independents, some of which have significantly
      greater resources. In order to grow the current asset base, replace and expand
      reserves, and increase operating income, the Company must select and acquire
      from third parties quality producing properties and prospects for future
      drilling. The Company has no control over the timing of when these opportunities
      may become available.  

Extensive
      federal, state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations, regulate
      the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the
      protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies issue rules and
      regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often difficult and
      costly to comply with and which may carry substantial administrative, civil
      and
      even criminal penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the
      oil
      and natural gas extractive industry increases its cost of doing business and
      consequently affects its profitability. These laws, rules and regulations affect
      the Company s operations, as well as the oil and gas exploration and production
      industry in general. The costs of such compliance have not been material to
      Peoples Energy Production to date. The Company believes that it is in
      substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws, rules and
      regulations and that continued compliance with existing  

-
          14
          - 

requirements
      will not have a material adverse impact on the Oil and Gas Production segment.
      The Company currently has no material estimated capital expenditures for
      environmental control facilities. 

The
      Energy Policy Act contains several provisions intended to encourage domestic
      production of oil and gas, such as greater access to Federal lands for onshore
      oil and gas leasing and permitting, and tax incentives to encourage oil refinery
      investment. The Energy Policy Act is not expected to have a significant effect
      on the Company s Oil and Gas Production segment. 

3.
      ENERGY MARKETING SEGMENT  

      Peoples
      Energy Services, one of the major contributors to the Energy Marketing segment,
      primarily provides gas, electricity and energy management services to
      industrial, commercial and residential customers regionally within
      Illinois  .
      Peoples
      Energy Services also provides gas in Michigan, Ohio and New York. 

Peoples
      Energy Services  operating income can be influenced by seasonal weather
      conditions and total margin can be impacted by usage. In addition, revenue
      sensitive items such as customer accounts receivable balances are typically
      impacted when natural gas or electric prices increase as certain products of
      the
      segment are tied to an index. However, some risk to accounts receivables and
      reserves for uncollectible accounts is mitigated by fixed price products offered
      to customers.  

Peoples
      Energy Services is one of the largest nonutility energy marketers in the
      northern Illinois retail energy marketplace. It has customers from a wide
      variety of commercial and industrial segments, as well as residential customers.
      This minimizes the impacts of business cycle risks in any one segment. Peoples
      Energy Services is certified by the Commission as an Alternative Retail Electric
      Supplier (ARES), authorizing it to be a nonutility marketer of electricity,
      and
      as an Alternative Gas Supplier (AGS), authorizing it to be a nonutility marketer
      of natural gas for residential and small commercial customers; AGS certification
      is not required to serve other customers. As of September 30, 2006, there were
      a
      total of 20 ARESs in addition to three electric utilities offering supply
      service outside their service territories and 12 AGSs in Illinois, as well
      as
      several other national gas marketers focused on the commercial and industrial
      segment. Peoples Energy Services is also currently licensed as an AGS in
      Michigan, a Competitive Retail Natural Gas Supplier (CRNGS) in Ohio, and a
      gas
      Energy Service Company (ESCO) in New York.  

Peoples
      Energy Resources, another major contributor to the Energy Marketing segment,
      provides wholesale services to marketers, utilities, pipelines and gas-fired
      power generation facilities. Peoples Energy Resources is authorized by the
      FERC
      to sell gas for resale at negotiated rates. The FERC conferred this authority
      in
      a rulemaking (Order 547), and Peoples Energy Resources did not need to seek
      specific approval to make sales for resale at negotiated rates. The FERC does
      not regulate the sales rates, nor are there any reporting requirements
      associated with these sales. The FERC, in November 2003, issued Order 644 in
      which it established a code of conduct applicable to entities making sales
      pursuant to Order 547 and required such sellers to report to the FERC whether
      they report prices to publications that publish natural gas price
      indices.

      ENERGY ASSETS SEGMENT  

      The
      Energy Assets segment, through Peoples Energy Resources, is engaged in the
      development, operation and ownership of electric generation facilities for
      sales
      to electric utilities and marketers. Currently, the Company has an ownership
      interest in one electric generation facility. Peoples Energy Resources and
      Dominion Energy, Inc. (Dominion) are equal investors in Elwood Energy LLC
      (Elwood), which owns and operates a 1,400-megawatt peaking facility near
      Chicago. The plant capacity has been sold through long-term contracts with
      Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Exelon) and Constellation Energy Commodities
      Group, Inc. Due to the structure of these contracts and the fact that Elwood
      is
      a peaking facility, the majority of Elwood s revenues and the Company s equity
      earnings in this investment are recognized in the Company s third and fourth
      fiscal quarters. 

The
      Company announced in February 2006 its intention to exit the power generation
      business.   On
      January 31, 2006, the Company sold its 100% interest in the Valencia Energy
      power development site in New Mexico. On May 31, 2006, the Company completed
      the
      sale of its 27% interest in the SCEP facility to Exelon Generation

          15
          - 

Company,
      LLC. On September 20, 2006, the Company announced that it signed an agreement
      with J-POWER USA Development Co., Ltd. (J-Power) to sell its 50% interest in
      the
      Elwood power generation facility and its 100% interest in a fully-permitted
      power development site, the COB Energy Facility (COB), for $110 million, subject
      to certain closing adjustments. These sales will complete the divestiture of
      substantially all power assets owned by Peoples Energy. The Board of Directors
      of J-Power's parent company approved the transactions on November 30, 2006.
      Financial results for power generation are now being reported by Peoples Energy
      as discontinued operations. Through Elwood and COB, the Company owned
      approximately 700 net Megawatts of power generation assets.  

Peoples
      Energy Resources owns a propane-based peaking plant and other contractual assets
      of pipeline transportation and storage in the Midwest region, which enables
      it
      to perform in other asset-based wholesale activities. Peoples Energy Resources
      owns approximately 40 miles of small diameter pipes, which are used to provide
      services to local refineries in the Chicago area. Peoples Energy Resources
      also
      owns 250 acres of land and related facilities in Will County,
      Illinois. 

The
      Energy Policy Act removes certain regulatory obstacles that could have delayed
      or impeded government approvals of and private investment in liquefied natural
      gas facilities, authorizes funding for coal gasification projects, and contains
      standards banning energy market manipulation and permitting substantially higher
      penalties for violations of such standards. 

5    .
      CORPORATE AND OTHER SEGMENT  

      Certain
      business development activities that do not fall under the four major business
      segments are reported in the Corporate and Other segment. Corporate
      administrative activities that support the business segments are also included
      in Corporate and Other. 

ITEM
      1A. Risk Factors 

Investors
      should consider carefully the following factors that could cause the Company s
      operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected.
      New risks may emerge at any time, and management cannot predict those risks
      or
      estimate the extent to which they may affect the Company s financial
      performance. 

Peoples
      Energy is a holding company and its assets consist primarily of investments
      in
      its subsidiaries; covenants in certain of the Company s financial instruments
      may limit its ability to pay dividends, thereby adversely impacting the
      valuation of the Company s common stock and access to
      capital.  

The
      Company s assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries. Dividends on
      its common stock depend on the earnings, financial condition and capital
      requirements of the Company s subsidiaries, principally Peoples Gas and North
      Shore Gas and the distribution or other payment of earnings from the
      subsidiaries to the Company in the form of dividends from the utilities, and
      in
      the case of its non-regulated subsidiaries dividends, loans, advances or
      repayment of loans and advances. The subsidiaries are distinct legal entities
      and have no obligation to pay any dividends or make advances or loans to the
      Company. Peoples Energy s ability to pay dividends on its common stock may also
      be limited by existing or future regulatory restrictions or agreement covenants
      limiting the right of its subsidiaries to pay dividends on their common
      stock. 

Commodity
      price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of the
      Company s businesses, thereby adversely impacting its liquidity and results of
      operations.  

The
      Company s energy businesses are sensitive to changes in natural gas, oil,
      electricity and other commodity prices. Any changes could affect the prices
      these businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position
      of
      their products and services. In the case of the Gas Distribution operations,
      costs for purchased gas and pipeline transportation and storage services are
      fully recovered through the Gas Charge, but increases in gas costs affect total
      retail prices and, therefore, the competitive position of the Company s Gas
      Distribution businesses relative to electricity and other forms of energy.
      In
      addition, the timing and extent of high natural gas  

-
          16
          - 

prices
      can materially adversely affect the Gas Distribution segment s accounts
      receivable, provision for uncollectible accounts, fuel cost and interest
      expense. The Company is also subject to margin requirements in connection with
      use of derivative financial instruments and these requirements could escalate
      if
      prices move adversely relative to hedge positions. 

The
      Company s earnings growth and the carrying value of the Company s oil and gas
      producing properties depends in part upon the prices received for its natural
      gas and oil production. Natural gas and oil prices historically have been
      volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. The prices
      for
      natural gas and oil are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond the
      Company s control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the level of
      consumer demand for, and the supply of, natural gas and oil, commodity
      processing, gathering and transportation availability, the level of imports
      of,
      and the price of, foreign natural gas and oil, the price and availability of
      alternative fuel sources, weather conditions, political conditions or
      hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions. Further, because over
      90%
      of the Company s proved reserves at September 30, 2006 were natural gas
      reserves, the Company is substantially more sensitive to changes in natural
      gas
      prices than to changes in oil prices. Declines in natural gas and oil prices
      would not only reduce revenue, but could reduce the amount of natural gas and
      oil that can be produced economically and, as a result, could adversely affect
      the financial results of the Oil and Gas Production segment. 

A
      significant decline in natural gas and oil prices could result in a downward
      revision of the Company s reserves and a write-down of the carrying value of
      natural gas and oil properties that would negatively impact the Company s net
      income and stockholders  equity. 

The
      Company has approximately 50% of anticipated production hedged for fiscal 2007,
      which is substantially lower than in recent years. This lower hedge percentage
      may potentially result in the Company having increased earnings
      volatility.  The Company will have the potential to realize
      higher prices if gas prices hold at or near current levels or lower prices
      if gas prices decline. 

The
      Company s use of derivative financial instruments could result in earnings
      volatility and financial losses.  

Some
      of
      the Company's subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments, including
      futures, swaps, collars and option contracts either traded on exchanges or
      executed over-the-counter with natural gas and power merchants as well as
      financial institutions, to hedge commodity price and interest rate risk.
      Fluctuating commodity prices could cause revenues, net income and cash
      requirements of the Company to be volatile due to the use of financial
      instruments that are not perfectly matched to the exposure (which may result
      from the nature of the derivative instrument used or as a result of a
      discontinued physical transaction), or if the Company's derivative instruments
      and hedging transactions fail to qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No.
      133. The Company may also incur financial losses if counterparties fail to
      perform under these instruments. Fluctuating commodity prices and related MTM
      accounting also could cause revenues and net income of the Company to be
      volatile due to the use of derivative instruments. For additional information
      concerning the use of derivatives, see Note 2L of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements. 

The
      Company s operating results may be adversely affected by mild
      weather.  

The
      Company s Gas Distribution businesses and retail business have historically
      delivered less natural gas, and consequently earned less income, when weather
      conditions are warmer than normal. Mild weather in the future could diminish
      the
      Company s revenues and results of operations and harm its financial condition.
      Although the Company may from time to time utilize weather insurance or
      financial weather derivatives to manage this risk, such measures result in
      the
      Company incurring costs and expose the Company to the credit risk of the
      counterparties in such transactions and, moreover, there can be no assurance
      that such measures will fully protect the Company from the effects of mild
      weather. (See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
      Risk Weather Risk.) 

-
          17
          - 

The
      Company s Gas Distribution subsidiaries depend on storage and transportation
      services purchased from interstate pipelines and on a storage field owned by
      Peoples Gas to meet their customers  gas requirements.  

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas meet a significant percentage of their customers  peak
      day, seasonal and annual gas requirements through withdrawals, pursuant to
      contracts, from storage facilities owned and operated by interstate pipelines
      and through deliveries of gas transported on interstate pipelines with which
      they or their gas suppliers have contracts. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas
      each
      contracts with multiple pipelines for these services, and it has gas supply
      contracts with multiple suppliers. If a pipeline were to fail to perform storage
      or transportation service, including for reasons of force majeure, on a peak
      day
      or other day with high volume gas requirements, Peoples Gas  and North Shore
      Gas  ability to meet all their customers  gas requirements may be impaired
      unless or until alternative supply arrangements were put in place. Likewise,
      Peoples Gas plans to meet approximately 40% of its peak day requirements from
      its own storage field. If that storage field, or the Peoples Gas-owned
      transmission pipeline used to transport storage gas to the market, were to
      be
      out of service for any reason, this could impair Peoples Gas  ability to meet
      its customers  full requirements on a peak day. Also, North Shore Gas purchases
      a storage service from Peoples Gas, and its ability to serve its customers
      could
      be adversely affected by failures at Peoples Gas  storage field. 

The
      Company s operations are subject to operational hazards and uninsured
      risks.  

The
      Company s Gas Distribution, Oil and Gas Production, and Energy Assets operations
      are subject to the inherent risks normally associated with those operations,
      including pipeline ruptures, damage caused by excavators, explosions, release
      of
      toxic substances, fires, adverse weather conditions, and other hazards, each
      of
      which could result in damage to or destruction of the Company s facilities or
      damages to persons and property. In addition, the Company s operations face
      possible risks associated with acts of intentional harm on these assets. The
      nature of the risks is such that some liabilities could exceed the Company s
      insurance policy limits, or, as in the case of environmental fines and
      penalties, cannot be insured. As a result, the Company could incur substantial
      costs that could adversely affect its future results of operations, cash flows
      or financial condition. A substantial portion of the Company s oil and gas
      production is transported on or processed by third party pipelines and
      processing plants. Those pipelines and processing plants are subject to the
      same
      risks. 

The
      Company s oil and gas producing operations involve many risks associated with
      estimates and assumptions used in making capital expenditure
      decisions.  

In
      addition to the operational risks described above, the Company s oil and gas
      drilling operations are also subject to the risk of not encountering
      commercially productive reservoirs and the Company may not recover all or any
      portion of its investment in those wells. Drilling for natural gas and oil
      can
      be unprofitable, not only because of dry holes but also due to wells that are
      productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at
      then
      realized prices after deducting drilling, operating, production taxes and other
      costs. 

In
      addition, estimating quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves is a
      complex process that involves significant interpretations of technical data
      and
      assumptions that result in reserve estimates being inherently imprecise. The
      Company utilizes a 10% discount factor when estimating the value of its
      reserves, as prescribed by the SEC, and this may not necessarily represent
      the
      most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to
      which
      the Company s production business or the natural gas and oil industry, in
      general, are subject. Any significant variations from the interpretations or
      assumptions used in the estimates or changes of conditions could cause the
      estimated quantities and net present value of the Company s reserves to differ
      materially from amounts disclosed in this document. 

The
      natural gas and oil reserve data included in this document represent the
      Company s best estimates. The Company uses outside reservoir engineers to
      provide an analysis of reserves and future production. These analyses are the
      basis for the Company s reserve estimates. Investors should not assume that the
      present values referred to in this document represent the current market value
      of the Company s estimated natural gas and oil  

-
          18
          - 

reserves.
      The timing of the production and the expenses from development and production
      of
      natural gas and oil properties will affect both the timing of actual future
      net
      cash flows from proved reserves and their present value. 

The
      agencies that regulate the Company s businesses and their customers affect
      profitability and potential regulatory changes may adversely affect the
      Company s businesses due to reductions in revenues or increased capital
      expenditures.  

The
      Company s utility subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of and regulation
      by the Commission, which has general supervisory and regulatory powers over
      practically all phases of the public utility business in Illinois, including
      rates and charges, issuance of securities, services and facilities, systems
      of
      accounts, investments, safety standards, transactions with affiliated interests
      and other matters. Recently, credit rating agencies have issued negative alerts
      on some Illinois utilities, citing as a concern a heightened level of
      politicizing of the regulatory process in Illinois, particularly with regard
      to
      electric utilities. If Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas  tariff rates were
      reduced in a future proceeding, or if the Commission denied recovery of certain
      costs presently allowed to be recovered through rates, the profitability of
      the
      utilities  businesses could be reduced. 

The
      utility subsidiaries and Peoples Energy Resources are also subject to U.S.
      Department of Transportation rules applicable to owners and operators of certain
      pipeline facilities. Regulatory requirements relating to the integrity of these
      pipelines require capital spending in order to maintain compliance with these
      requirements. Any additional laws or regulations that are enacted could
      significantly increase the amount of these expenditures. 

Peoples
      Gas  and Peoples Energy Wholesale Marketing s midstream gas services that are
      reflected in the Gas Distribution and Energy Marketing segments, respectively,
      are regulated by the FERC. Additional or different regulations imposed by the
      FERC could affect the profitability of these segments. 

The
      Company s Gas Distribution and Energy Assets businesses are also subject to
      costly and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. The cost of future
      environmental compliance could be significant. 

The
      Illinois state legislature is reviewing potential legislation to modify the
      regulatory process applicable to electric transmission and distribution
      companies. This has increased regulatory uncertainty surrounding retail electric
      unbundling in Illinois and could adversely impact retail electric sales by
      Peoples Energy Services within the Energy Marketing segment. 

An
      adverse decision in proceedings before the Commission concerning the prudence
      review of the Company s gas purchases could require a significant refund
      obligation.  

For
      each
      utility subsidiary, the Commission conducts annual proceedings regarding the
      reconciliation of revenues from the Gas Charge and related gas costs. In these
      proceedings, the accuracy of the reconciliation of revenues and costs is
      reviewed and the prudence of gas costs recovered through the Gas Charge is
      examined by interested parties. If the Commission were to find that the
      reconciliation was inaccurate or any gas costs were imprudently incurred, the
      Commission would order the utility to refund the affected amount to customers
      through subsequent Gas Charge filings. The Commission has ordered refunds to
      the
      Company's utility customers in connection with prior years' gas charge
      reconciliation proceedings (see Notes 2C and 8A of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements). Proceedings regarding Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas
      for
      fiscal year 2005 costs are currently pending before the Commission. The outcome
      of these proceedings cannot be predicted. (See Note 8A of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

-
          19
          - 

A
      change in the Commission s approved rate mechanisms for recovery of
      environmental remediation costs at former manufactured gas sites of the
      Company s subsidiaries, or adverse decisions with respect to the prudence of
      costs actually incurred, could result in the Company reversing significant
      amounts currently reflected as regulatory assets, resulting in a decrease to
      net
      income.  

As
      described more fully in Note 7A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements, the Company s subsidiaries are accruing liabilities and deferring
      costs (recorded as regulatory assets) incurred in connection with the
      subsidiaries' former manufactured gas sites, including related legal expenses,
      pending recovery through rates or from other entities. At September 30, 2006,
      regulatory assets of $313 million have been recorded. This amount reflects
      the
      net amount of (1) costs incurred to date, (2) carrying costs, (3) amounts
      recovered from insurance companies, other entities and from customers, and
      (4)
      management's best estimates of the costs the utilities will spend in the future
      for investigating and remediating the manufactured gas sites ($269 million
      for
      the Company on a consolidated basis). Management has recorded liabilities for
      the amounts described in clause (4) of the preceding sentence. Management
      believes that any such costs that are not recoverable from other entities or
      from insurance carriers are recoverable through rates for utility services
      under
      Commission-approved mechanisms for the recovery of prudently incurred costs.
      A
      change in these rate recovery mechanisms, however, or a decision by the
      Commission that some or all of these costs were not prudently incurred, could
      result in the present recognition as expense of some or all of these
      costs. 

An
      inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of the
      Company s business plan.  

The
      Company relies on access to both short-term money markets and longer-term
      capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements
      not satisfied by the cash flows from its operations. Management believes that
      the Company and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these
      financial markets based upon current credit ratings. However, certain
      disruptions outside of the Company s control may increase its cost of borrowing
      or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets. Such
      disruptions could include an economic downturn, the bankruptcy of an unrelated
      energy company or downgrades to the Company s credit ratings. 

Restrictions
      on the Company s ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to
      execute its business plan as scheduled. 

Adverse
      changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect the
      Company.  

The
      Company's long-term senior unsecured debt is rated Baa2 by Moody s Investors
      Services and BBB+ by Standard and Poor s Rating Group. Peoples Gas' and North
      Shore Gas' long-term senior secured debt is rated A1 by Moody's Investor
      Services and A- by Standard and Poor's. Downgrades in the credit ratings of
      the
      Company or the utility subsidiaries could impair our ability to access capital
      markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs. In addition,
      reductions in credit ratings could require the affected company to post
      additional collateral related to various trading contracts which could reduce
      its liquidity. 

Risks
      Relating to the Merger  

The
      merger may not be completed, which could adversely affect Peoples Energy s
      business operations and stock prices.  

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy have not yet obtained all federal and state
      regulatory clearances, consents and approvals required to complete the merger.
      Governmental or regulatory agencies could still seek to block or challenge
      the
      merger or could impose restrictions they deem necessary or desirable in the
      public interest as a condition to approving the merger. If these approvals
      are
      not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions
      set
      forth in the merger agreement, then neither WPS Resources nor Peoples Energy
      will be obligated to complete the merger. 

-
          20
          - 

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy are each subject to termination fees of $45 million
      or the reimbursement of $15 million of merger-related out-of-pocket expenses
      if
      it terminates the merger under certain circumstances specified in the merger
      agreement. 

In
      addition, the merger agreement contains customary other closing conditions,
      which may not be satisfied or waived. If WPS Resources and Peoples Energy are
      unable to complete the merger, Peoples Energy would be subject to a number
      of
      risks, including the following: 

Peoples
                Energy would not realize the benefits of the proposed merger, including
                any synergies from combining the two
                companies; 

the
                trading price of Peoples Energy common stock may decline to the extent
                that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the
                merger
                will be completed; and 

Peoples
                Energy would continue to be exposed to the general competitive pressures
                and risks discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
                ended
                September 30, 2006, which pressures and risks may be increased if
                the
                merger is not completed. 

The
      occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have
      a
      material adverse effect on the results of operations or the trading price of
      Peoples Energy common stock. 

Peoples
      Energy will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions
      while the merger is pending that could adversely affect its
      business.  

Uncertainty
      about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse
      effect on Peoples Energy, regardless of whether the merger is eventually
      completed, and, consequently, on the combined company. Although Peoples Energy
      has taken steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties
      may
      impair Peoples Energy s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel
      until the merger is completed, or the merger agreement is terminated, and for
      a
      period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others
      that
      deal with Peoples Energy to seek to change existing business relationships
      with
      WPS Resources or Peoples Energy. 

Employee
      retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging during the pendency
      of
      the merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty
      about their future roles with the combined company. The departure of existing
      key employees or the failure of potential key employees to accept employment
      with the Company, despite Peoples Energy s retention and recruiting efforts,
      could have a material adverse impact on Peoples Energy s business, financial
      condition and operating results, regardless of whether the merger is eventually
      completed.  

The
      pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration of WPS Resources
      and Peoples Energy may place a significant burden on management and internal
      resources. The diversion of management attention away from day-to-day business
      concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration
      process could have a material adverse impact on Peoples Energy s business,
      financial condition and operating results, regardless of whether the merger
      is
      eventually completed. 

In
      addition, the merger agreement restricts each of WPS Resources and Peoples
      Energy, without the other party s consent, from making certain acquisitions and
      taking other specified actions until the merger occurs or the merger agreement
      terminates. These restrictions may prevent Peoples Energy from pursuing
      otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to their
      businesses prior to completion of the merger or termination of the merger
      agreement.  

The
      value of shares of WPS Resources common stock to be received by Peoples Energy
      shareholders in the merger will fluctuate.  

-
          21
          - 

In
      the
      merger, each share of Peoples Energy common stock outstanding immediately prior
      to completion of the merger will be converted into the right to receive 0.825
      shares of WPS Resources common stock (with cash paid in lieu of fractional
      shares). The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect stock
      price changes prior to the completion of the merger. 

The
      market prices of WPS Resources common stock and Peoples Energy common stock
      immediately prior to the effective time of the completion of the merger may
      vary
      significantly from their market prices at the date of the joint proxy
      statement/prospectus and at the date of the special meetings of the shareholders
      of WPS Resources and the shareholders of Peoples Energy. These variations may
      be
      the result of various factors, including: 

changes
                in the business, operations or prospects of WPS Resources and/or
                Peoples
                Energy; 

speculation
                regarding the likelihood that the merger will be completed and the
                timing
                of the completion; 

general
                market and economic conditions; and 

litigation
                and/or regulatory developments. 

The
      merger is subject to receipt of consent or approval from governmental entities
      that could delay or prevent the completion of the merger or impose conditions
      that could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or that could
      cause abandonment of the merger.  

To
      complete the merger, WPS Resources and Peoples Energy need to obtain approvals
      or consents from, or make filings with, a number of United States federal and
      state public utility, antitrust and other regulatory authorities. 

While
      WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy each believe that they will receive the required
      statutory approvals and other clearances for the merger, there can be no
      assurance as to the timing of these approvals and clearances or their ability
      to
      obtain these approvals and clearances on satisfactory terms or otherwise. There
      can be no assurance that any of these approvals will be obtained or, if
      obtained, that these approvals will not contain terms or conditions that could
      reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company
      following completion of the merger.  

On December
      6, 2006, at special meetings of shareholders held by WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy, shareholders of both companies approved the
      proposed merger transaction.  Additional approvals will have to be obtained
      to complete the merger.  Accordingly, the companies' shareholder approvals
      have been obtained before the terms of any conditions that may be imposed
      to obtain additional approvals are known. As a result, WPS Resources and Peoples
      Energy may make prospective decisions to waive a condition or approve certain
      actions required to obtain necessary approvals without seeking further
      shareholder approval. 

The
      anticipated benefits of combining WPS Resources and Peoples Energy may not
      be
      realized.  

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy entered into the merger agreement with the
      expectation that the merger would result in various benefits, including, among
      other things, synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. 

Although
      Peoples Energy and WPS Resources expect to achieve the anticipated benefits
      of
      the merger, including the synergies, achieving them is subject to a number
      of
      uncertainties, including: 

-
          22
          - 

whether
                United States federal and state public utility, antitrust and other
                regulatory authorities whose approval is required to complete the
                merger
                impose conditions on the merger or require the combined company to
                share a
                disproportionate amount of the expected or achieved synergies of
                the
                merger with customers, any of which may have an adverse effect on
                the
                combined company; 

resolution
                of pending and future rate cases and negotiations (including the
                recovery
                of deferred costs) and other regulatory decisions impacting WPS Resources 
                and Peoples Energy s regulated businesses, including the rate treatment of
                synergies and the cost to achieve those
                synergies; 

the
                ability of the two companies to combine certain of their operations
                or
                take advantage of expected growth opportunities;

general
                market and economic conditions;  

general
                competitive factors in the market place;
                and 

higher
                than expected costs required to achieve the expected
                synergies. 

No
      assurance can be given that these benefits will be achieved or, if achieved,
      the
      timing of their achievement. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits
      could
      result in increased costs and decreases in the amount of expected revenues
      of
      the combined company. 

The
      integration of WPS Resources and Peoples Energy following the merger will
      present significant challenges that may result in a decline in the anticipated
      potential benefits of the merger.  

The
      merger involves the integration of two companies that previously operated
      independently. The difficulties of combining the companies  operations
      include: 

combining
                the best practices of two companies, including utility operations,
                non-regulated marketing operations and staff
                functions; 

the
                necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations,
                systems
                and facilities; 

integrating
                personnel with diverse business backgrounds and organizational
                cultures; 

reducing
                the costs associated with each company s operations;
                and 

preserving
                important relationships of both WPS Resources and Peoples Energy
                and
                resolving potential conflicts that may
                arise. 

The
      process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of
      momentum in, the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses
      and the possible loss of key personnel. The diversion of management s attention
      and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and
      the
      integration of the two companies  operations could have an adverse effect on the
      business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the
      combined company after the merger. 

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy expect the merger to generate potential pre-tax
      cost synergies of $94 million for the combined company on an annualized basis
      by
      the end of the fifth full year of operations following completion of the merger
      (excluding costs of integration). These savings may not be realized within
      the
      time periods contemplated, or at all.  

Peoples
      Energy will incur significant transaction, merger-related and restructuring
      costs in connection with the merger.  

Peoples
      Energy expects to incur costs associated with combining the operations of the
      two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the
      merger. The combined company also will incur restructuring and integration
      costs
      in connection with the merger. The estimated total cost to WPS Resources (and
      ultimately the combined company) of accomplishing the merger and achieving
      the
      synergies and cost savings is approximately $186 million in transaction and
      integration costs, most of which will be incurred through 2010. The costs
      related to restructuring will be treated as a liability and will be included
      in
      the total purchase price or expensed, depending on the nature of the
      restructuring activity. Although WPS Resources and Peoples Energy expect that

-
          23
          - 

the
      elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other
      efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset
      incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time,
      any
      net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. 

The
      combined company will record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely
      affect the combined company s operating results.  

The
      merger will be accounted for as a purchase by WPS Resources in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles. Under the purchase method of
      accounting, the assets and liabilities of Peoples Energy will be recorded,
      as of
      completion, at their respective fair values and added to those of WPS Resources.
      The reported financial condition and results of operations of WPS Resources
      issued after completion of the merger will reflect Peoples Energy balances
      and
      results after completion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively
      to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Peoples
      Energy. Following completion of the merger, the earnings of the combined company
      will reflect purchase accounting adjustments, including increased amortization
      and depreciation expense for acquired assets. 

Under
      the
      purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to
      Peoples Energy s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible
      assets, based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the merger.
      The excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as
      goodwill. We expect that the merger will result in the creation of goodwill
      based upon the application of purchase accounting. To the extent the value
      of
      goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, the combined company may be required
      to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential
      impairment charge could have a material impact on the combined company s
      operating results.

      of
      Operations  

INTRODUCTION  

      In
      this
      section, management discusses the financial condition, results of operations,
      cash flows, and expected future performance of the Company and its four primary
      business segments. The discussion applies to Peoples Energy and its business
      segments on a consolidated basis with the exception of the section titled
 Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas Discussions,  which provides information
      specific to the Company s two regulated utility subsidiaries. Certain other
      results of operations and information specific to Peoples Gas and North Shore
      Gas are also found in Item 1 Business Gas Distribution Segment and in this Item
      7 under Liquidity and Capital Resources. 

Management s
      discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated
      Financial Statements and related notes. Unless otherwise noted, earnings per
      share are presented on a diluted basis. 

EXECUTIVE
      SUMMARY  

      Peoples
      Energy is a diversified energy company that conducts operations in four main
      business segments: 

Gas
                Distribution 

Oil
                and Gas Production 

Energy
                Marketing  

Energy
                Assets  

The
      Gas
      Distribution segment has the most significant impact on the Company s
      consolidated financial results. The remaining segments represent a portfolio
      of
      complementary energy businesses that the Company has developed to diversify
      the
      sources of consolidated operating income.  

The
      regulated gas distribution utilities, with service territories in Chicago and
      its northern suburbs, form the core of Peoples Energy. Until recently they
      have
      generated reliable earnings near the rate of return on equity allowed by the
      Commission, approximately 11%, since 1994. Fiscal 2006 operating results reflect
      continued erosion in Gas Distribution segment results, including a $107.3
      million pre-tax gas charge settlement, pursuant to Commission orders issued
      on
      March 28, 2006 that settled gas charge reconciliation proceedings for fiscal
      years 2001 through 2004. Our two natural gas utilities, Peoples Gas and North
      Shore Gas, have not increased their delivery rates in eleven years, during
      which
      time operating costs have increased and throughput has declined.  

The
      business environment in which Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas operate benefits
      from a fundamentally strong economic base. The service territories are mature,
      and natural gas has a high penetration in its markets. However, gas usage per
      customer has declined steadily in recent years due to lower weather-normalized
      demand primarily reflecting customer conservation. It is unclear how much of
      the
      load loss is permanent, but customers are reacting to higher bills by lowering
      their consumption. 

The
      diversified energy businesses use a low to moderate risk approach to develop
      assets and services that can provide long-term growth and supplement the base
      of
      utility earnings. Since 1998, the contribution of operating income from the
      Company s diversified businesses has grown from an insignificant amount to $59.0
      million (including $17.1 million in operating income from the discontinued
      operations of the power generation business) in fiscal 2006. 

The
      Company announced in February 2006 its intention to exit the power generation
      business. On January 31, 2006, the Company sold its 100% interest in the
      Valencia Energy power development site in New Mexico. On May 31, 2006, the
      Company completed the sale of its 27% interest in the SCEP facility to Exelon
      Generation Company, LLC. On September 20, 2006, the Company announced that
      it
      signed an agreement with J-POWER USA Development Co., Ltd. (J-Power) to sell
      its
      50% interest in the Elwood power generation facility and its 100% interest
      in a
      fully-permitted power development site, the COB Energy Facility (COB), for
      $110
      million, subject to certain closing adjustments. These sales will complete
      the
      divestiture of substantially all power assets owned by Peoples Energy. The
      Board
      of Directors of J-Power's parent company approved the transactions on

-
          30
          - 

November
      30, 2006. Financial results for power generation are now being reported by
      Peoples Energy as discontinued operations. Through Elwood and COB, the Company
      owned approximately 700 net Megawatts of power generation assets. 

Merger.
         Pursuant
      to the definitive merger agreement entered into between Peoples Energy and
      WPS
      Resources on July 10, 2006, in August the companies jointly filed an application
      for approval of the merger with the Commission. Required regulatory approvals
      at
      the federal level, including those with the SEC, FERC, and Department of
      Justice, either have been or are expected to be received by December 31, 2006.
      Special shareholder meetings were held by both companies on December 6, 2006,
      to
      seek shareholder approval of the transaction.  
      Shareholders of both WPS Resources and Peoples Energy approved the merger.
        The
      companies are targeting a closing date for the merger during the first calendar
      quarter of 2007. (See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      for further discussion of the merger.) 

Rate
      Case.   
      The
      Company announced in September 2005 that Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas planned
      to file delivery rate increases with the Commission. However, those plans have
      been postponed to allow Peoples Energy and WPS Resources to focus on gaining
      approvals for the merger. The companies are seeking expedited consideration
      of
      the application for approval of the merger by the Commission. The application
      indicates that Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas will further postpone filing
      rate
      cases until early 2007, with new rates to take effect in 2008 due to the normal
      11-month rate case process in Illinois. 

Strategic
      Restructuring.   
      In
      fiscal 2004 the Company took actions to improve the financial performance of
      its
      utilities by restructuring its utility and corporate support areas. The
      organizational restructuring targeted elimination of over 100 salaried
      positions, or about 10% of the Company s nonunion workforce. Overall, about 300
      employees accepted the voluntary severance offer that accompanied the
      restructuring. (See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.) 

Earnings
      Outlook.   
      Due to
      the pending merger with WPS Resources, Peoples Energy is not providing a
      specific earnings outlook for fiscal 2007 at this time. However, the Company
      expects some improvement in earnings, excluding the impact of merger-related
      expenses, driven primarily by higher earnings from the Energy Marketing and
      Oil
      and Gas Production segments. Excluding the effects in fiscal 2006 of the gas
      charge settlement, Gas Distribution results are not likely to improve materially
      over fiscal 2006 absent increases in delivery rates, which are not expected
      before the second quarter of fiscal 2008.  

Key
      planning assumptions utilized by the Company for fiscal 2007 include normal
      weather based on a 10-year average of 6,175 degree days (representing a change
      from the Company s previous degree day planning assumption, which in fiscal 2006
      utilized a 30-year average of 6,408 degree days), an average NYMEX gas price
      of
      $7.50 per MMbtu, a 2.25% utility bad debt rate, and higher expenses in the
      Gas
      Distribution and Corporate and Other segments. Capital expenditures are
      estimated at $250 million, with nearly half in the Gas Distribution segment
      and
      the remainder primarily in the Oil and Gas Production segment. No acquisitions
      have been budgeted in the Oil and Gas Production segment. Other assumptions
      include higher interest expense, a 35% effective tax rate, and slightly higher
      common shares outstanding. 

Financial
      Results    

      Financial
      results for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 are summarized in the following table.
      Operating income for fiscal 2006 includes a $107.3 million pre-tax charge ($1.68
      per share after tax) for settlement of utility gas charge proceedings for fiscal
      years 2001 through 2004, as well as related civil litigation, and $8.9 million
      of expenses (pre-tax) related to the Company s recently announced proposed
      merger with WPS Resources. Results for fiscal 2005 include $13.1 million in
      pension charges (pre-tax) related to the Company s 2004 organizational
      restructuring. Income from discontinued operations relates to the Company s
      power generation business. Ongoing operating income (non-GAAP) and ongoing
      income from continuing operations (non-GAAP) are defined as GAAP operating
      income and GAAP income from continuing operations, respectively, adjusted to
      exclude the effects of the fiscal 2006 settlement charge, merger expenses,
      and
      last year s restructuring charge. Management believes that such measures of
      ongoing results are useful for year-over-year comparisons since charges of
      this

-
          31
          - 

magnitude
      are infrequent and affect the comparability of operating results. Ongoing
      operating income and ongoing income from continuing operations are used
      internally to measure performance and in reports for management and the
      Company s Board of Directors. 

Ongoing
      operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $44.5 million, primarily driven
      by
      the following items: 

Gas
                Distribution deliveries for the year declined an estimated 4% from
                the
                prior year due to customer conservation. In addition, fiscal 2006
                utility
                deliveries were negatively impacted by 10% warmer than normal weather.
                Gas
                Distribution results were also negatively impacted by sharply higher
                operating expenses. 

Pursuant
                to the amended gas charge settlement, Hub revenues for the Gas
                Distribution segment in fiscal 2006 are being recorded as a credit
                to
                customers  gas charges, negatively impacting year-over-year comparisons by
                $10.7 million. 

Oil
                and Gas Production volumes were up 2% for fiscal 2006 compared to
                a year
                ago. This improvement reflects strong performance of both existing
                and new
                wells and the impact of the Company s fiscal 2006 Will-Drill acquisition,
                offset by the normal decline rate of existing production. Net realized
                prices increased sharply in fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher
                operating costs. 

Energy
                Marketing results were negatively impacted by an unrealized loss
                of $17.6
                million for the year due to LOCOM inventory adjustments and MTM accounting
                of energy contracts, the impact of which was magnified by a significant
                decline in the market price of natural gas during the latter half
                of
                September 2006. Approximately $15 million of the year-end impact
                from
                these adjustments is timing related and is expected to reverse over
                fiscal
                2007. 

Year-over-year
                comparisons were negatively impacted by a $6.8 million gain in last
                year s
                fourth quarter associated with the sale by Trigen-Peoples District
                Energy
                (of which Peoples Energy owned a 50% interest) of its district heating
                and
                cooling plant in Chicago, which was reported in the Corporate and
                Other
                segment. 

RESULTS
      OF OPERATIONS  

Statement
      of Operations Variations   

       Fiscal
      2006   .
      The
      Company s revenues and cost of energy sold increased $418.4 million and $398.9
      million, respectively. The increases are due to the impact of higher commodity
      prices at the Gas Distribution and Energy  

-
          32
          - 

Marketing
      segments as well as a 2% year-over-year increase in average daily production
      volumes and higher net realized prices at the Oil and Gas Production segment.
      These increases were partially offset by the impacts on the Gas Distribution
      segment of warmer weather and an estimated 4% decrease in deliveries resulting
      from customer conservation. Revenue comparisons were also adversely impacted
      by
      the change in the regulatory treatment of Hub revenue in the Gas Distribution
      segment. 

In
        fiscal
      2006, the Company recorded a $107.3 million pretax charge related to a
      settlement of the Company's gas charge proceedings for fiscal years 2001 through
      2004 approved by the Commission, as discussed in Notes 2C and 8A of the Notes
      to
      Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, the Company recorded $8.9 million
      of
      costs incurred in connection with the Merger. See Note 1 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
      Merger. 

In
      fiscal
      2005, the Company recorded $13.1 million in pension-related charges
      resulting from its organizational restructuring commenced in the fall of fiscal
      2004 (as described in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements). 

Utility
      environmental costs increased $3.2 million for fiscal 2006 and relate to
      investigation and remediation activities at multiple sites that formerly had
      operations for gas manufacturing and the storage of manufactured gas (see Note
      7
      of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further discussion). These
      costs are recovered through the utilities' rate mechanism and a similar amount
      is included in revenues, therefore these costs do not affect operating
      income. 

Operation
      and maintenance expense, excluding the above-mentioned merger costs,
      environmental costs and restructuring-related pension charges, increased $31.0
      million. Significant items to note in fiscal 2006 were: 

Increased
                bad debt expense at the Gas Distribution segment of $6.5 million
                for
                fiscal 2006 due to high natural gas prices and their corresponding
                impact
                on revenues. 

Increased
                pension expense at Corporate and the Gas Distribution segment totaling
                $9.9 million due to lower discount
                rates. 

Increased
                direct labor costs at Corporate and the Gas Distribution segment
                totaling
                $4.6 million for fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in wages
                and
                headcount. 

Increased
                lease operating, exploration and general and administrative costs
                at the
                Oil and Gas Production segment totaling $7.5
                million. 

Other
      Variances for 2006.  

DD A
                increased $7.5 million in total and at the Oil and Gas Production
                segment
                increased $6.7 million, primarily due to the impacts of higher production
                and higher DD A rates. 

Taxes,
                other than income taxes, increased $16.7 million primarily due to
                higher
                revenue taxes ($13.9 million) in the Gas Distribution segment due
                to
                higher revenues. Revenue taxes are recovered through the utilities  rate
                mechanism and a similar amount included in revenues; therefore, these
                costs do not affect operating
                income. 

Equity
                investment income was $7.8 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $10.3
                million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 results include the $7.8 million
                pretax gain associated with the first quarter sale of certain assets
                at
                the Company s EnerVest Energy, L.P. (EnerVest) partnership. Fiscal 2005
                results include a $6.8 million gain related to the fourth quarter
                sale of
                assets by the Company's equity investment, Trigen-Peoples District
                Energy
                (recorded in the Corporate and Other segment). Fiscal 2005 results
                also
                reflect a full year of equity investment income from both these
                investments. 

Interest
                expense increased $11.0 million due primarily to higher interest
                rates,
                higher short-term borrowing balances, and an increase in gas costs
                refundable to customers through rate
                adjustments. 

Income
                tax expense decreased $60.8 million primarily due to the charge for
                the
                amended settlement agreement related to the Company's gas charge
                proceedings and related tax benefit of $42.7 million. The effective
                tax
                rate on fiscal 2006 ongoing income (non-GAAP), excluding the impact
                of the
                gas charge settlement and merger costs) was about 32%, down from
                36% last
                year, due to the impact of lower income before taxes and federal
                Medicare
                subsidies excludable from taxable
                income.

Pre-tax
                income from discontinued operations totaled $17.1 million for fiscal
                2006
                compared to $18.7 million in fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2006 results included
                a
                $4.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of SCEP, a $1.8 million pre-tax
                loss from the sale of the Valencia development site, and lower
                depreciation expense at Elwood. Fiscal 2005 results reflect a full
                year of
                SCEP equity investment income. 

Fiscal
      2005   .
      The
      Company s revenues and cost of energy sold increased $339.4 million and $337.6
      million, respectively, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. The increases
      are
      due to higher commodity prices in the Gas Distribution segment and increased
      sales volumes in the Energy Marketing segment, partially offset by a 5.1%
      decrease in Gas Distribution deliveries resulting from warmer weather and
      ongoing conservation measures by utility customers. In addition, average daily
      production volumes at the Oil and Gas Production segment were down 12% compared
      to the prior year due to well performance, rig availability, and other timing
      delays. 

The
      Company recorded $13.1 million in pension-related charges in fiscal 2005
      resulting from its organizational restructuring commenced in 2004, compared
      to
      $17.0 million in restructuring costs recorded in fiscal 2004 (as described
      in
      Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).  

Utility
      environmental costs increased $13.1 million and relate to investigation and
      remediation activities at multiple sites that formerly had operations for gas
      manufacturing and the storage of manufactured gas.  

Operation
      and maintenance expense, excluding the above-mentioned environmental costs
      and
      restructuring-related pension charges, decreased $3.3 million. Significant
      items
      to note in fiscal 2005 were: 

Decreased
                direct labor costs primarily at Corporate and the Gas Distribution
                segment
                of $16.4 million as a result of the organizational
                restructuring. 

Exploration
                costs in the Oil and Gas Production segment decreased $5.1 million,
                reflecting a significant dry hole expense recognized in fiscal
                2004. 

Lease
                operating expense and general and administrative expenses in the
                Oil and
                Gas Production segment increased $5.1 million in aggregate primarily
                as a
                result of a general increase in the cost of goods and
                services. 

Increased
                outside service expense of $3.7 million, much of which related to
                Sarbanes-Oxley compliance work. 

Increased
                insurance, employee group insurance and other benefit expenses totaling
                $6.6 million. 

Other
      Variances for 2005.  

DD A
                decreased $8.1 million mainly due to the $6.6 million impact of the
                approval by the Commission in April 2005 of new depreciation rates
                that
                reflect longer useful lives on utility plant (Commission Depreciation
                Order). The Oil and Gas Production segment also had lower DD A expense
                ($1.6 million) in fiscal 2005. 

Taxes,
                other than income taxes, increased $14.3 million primarily due to
                higher
                revenue taxes in the Gas Distribution segment.

Equity
                investment income increased $5.9 million primarily due to the $6.8
                million
                gain related to the sale of assets by the Company's equity investment,
                Trigen-Peoples District Energy.  

Interest
                expense increased $2.2 million due primarily to higher interest
                rates. 

Income
                tax expense increased $3.9 million as tax expense in fiscal 2004
                was
                positively impacted by several items, including adjustments to accrued
                income taxes based on updated estimates of income tax liabilities
                and tax
                legislation which resulted in the Company realizing tax benefits
                from
                dividends reinvested in Peoples Energy stock under the Company's
                Employee
                Stock Ownership Plan. 

Income
                from discontinued operations, net of taxes, increased $4.5 million
                primarily due to the results of the Energy Assets segment s Elwood
                facility, which included the Company s portion ($4.1 million) of a
                reduction in prior and current period expenses, primarily depreciation
                on
                generating equipment.

Segment
      Discussion    

      A
      summary
      of the Company s operating income by segment, income from discontinued
      operations, and variations between periods, is presented below. 

Gas
      Distribution Segment.   
      Revenues
      of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are directly impacted by fluctuations in
      weather because both companies have a large number of heating customers.
      Fluctuations in weather have the potential to significantly impact year-to-year
      comparisons of operating income and cash flow. 

Revenues
      of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are also affected by changes in the unit
      cost
      of the utilities  gas purchases and do not include the cost of gas supplies for
      customers who purchase gas directly from producers and marketers. In a steady
      gas price environment, the unit cost of gas does not have a significant direct
      effect on operating income because the utilities  tariffs provide for
      dollar-for-dollar recovery of gas costs. (See Note 2K of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements.) However, significant changes in gas costs
      can materially affect the reserve for uncollectible accounts, customer demand
      and working capital needs. 

Fiscal
      2006 revenues   for
      the
      Gas Distribution segment increased $233.2 million over 2005, primarily due
      to
      the impact of changes in commodity prices (an increase of $317 million) that
      are
      recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This impact was partially offset by
      decreases in deliveries due to warmer weather ($21 million), lower
      weather-normalized demand ($98 million) and by the impact of the change in
      the
      regulatory treatment of Hub revenues ($10.7 million) due to the amended
      settlement agreement. Operating income for fiscal 2006 decreased $150.1 million
      reflecting the impact of the amended settlement agreement. The $107.3 million
      in
      settlement charges recorded in fiscal 2006 and the $13.3 million liability
      recognized in prior periods reflect the following settlement amounts: $100
      million in refunds to customers; $5 million related to the payment to the City
      and the AG pursuant to the settlement agreement; $10.7 million to reflect a
      change in regulatory treatment for fiscal 2005 Hub revenues; and an estimated
      $5
      million net increase in bad debt expense primarily related to the termination
      of
      collection activities on approximately $207 million of bad debt written off
      during fiscal years 2000-2005.  

For
      fiscal  
      2006,
      ongoing (non-GAAP) operating income was $94.6 million compared to $137.3 million
      last year. The decrease was due primarily to the impact of lower gas deliveries
      ($10.7 million), including an estimated 4% decline in weather normalized demand
      due to the impact of customer conservation, a weather insurance recovery
      recorded in fiscal 2005 ($3.5 million), the change in treatment of 2006 Hub
      revenues ($10.7 million), and higher operating expenses ($18.3 million). Weather
      for fiscal 2006 was 89 degree days or 2% warmer than last year. The increase
      in
      operating costs primarily reflected higher pension expenses ($7.7 million),
      labor-related expenses  

-
          35
          - 

($2.1
      million), rate case costs ($2.0 million) and higher bad debt expense. Bad debt
      increased $6.5 million due to high natural gas prices and their corresponding
      impact on revenues. The bad debt accrual rate remained unchanged at
      approximately 2.25% of revenue.  

Fiscal
      2005 revenues increased $186.6 million compared to fiscal 2004, primarily due
      to
      the impact on revenues of higher commodity prices ($221 million) that are
      recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Partially offsetting this effect were
      decreases in deliveries due primarily to warmer weather ($31 million). Weather
      was 4% warmer compared to fiscal 2004. Operating income decreased $3.8 million
      compared with the previous year due to the effects of warmer weather ($5
      million), lower weather-normalized deliveries ($8 million), higher outside
      services expense ($3.0 million), the 2004 insurance recovery ($2.5 million)
      related to mercury cleanup costs incurred in prior years and increases in
      numerous other nonlabor expenses aggregating $11.3 million. Partially offsetting
      these negative variations are the effect of the fiscal 2004 accounts receivable
      adjustment ($6.9 million), decreased direct labor costs related to the
      organizational restructuring ($9.6 million), reduced depreciation expense ($6.6
      million) as a result of the Commission Depreciation Order, and increased hub
      operating income ($2.2 million).

The
      following table summarizes revenue, deliveries and other statistics for the
      Gas
      Distribution segment. 

(1) 

As
                used above, net margin is not a financial measure computed under
                GAAP but
                represents an operating performance measure. Gross margin is the
                GAAP
                measure most closely related to net margin. Management believes net
                margin
                to be useful in understanding the Gas Distribution segment's operations
                because the utility subsidiaries are allowed, under their tariffs,
                to
                recover gas costs, revenue taxes and environmental costs from their
                customers on a dollar-for-dollar
                basis. 

(3) 

Margin
                per Dth is based upon gas distribution and transportation activity
                and
                excludes the impact of hub revenues and hub
                volumes.

          37
          - 

Oil
      and Gas Production Segment.   
      Revenues
      and operating income for fiscal 2006 increased $26.1 million and $14.2 million,
      respectively, compared with the same period last year. The increase in revenue
      is due primarily to higher net realized commodity prices as older hedge
      positions continued to roll off and a 2% increase in equivalent average daily
      production. The improvement in production from a year ago reflects the results
      of the Company s 2006 drilling program and the impact of the February 2006
      acquisition of properties from Will-Drill Resources, Inc. (Will-Drill),
      partially offset by the normal decline of existing production. Fiscal 2006
      operating income results benefited from significantly higher net realized prices
      due to a lower percentage of gas volumes hedged (71% compared to nearly 100%
      a
      year ago), a small increase in production, and higher results from the Company s
      EnerVest partnership, which benefited from a $7.8 million pretax gain associated
      with the sale of assets. Last year s net realized price was negatively impacted
      by an $8.4 million hedge ineffectiveness charge resulting from wider than normal
      differentials between NYMEX and wellhead prices primarily due to the impact
      of
      hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The improvements in production and realized
      commodity prices were partially offset by higher operating costs ($17.3
      million), most notably higher general and administrative expense ($6.0 million)
      and depletion expenses ($6.7 million). In fiscal 2006, the Company drilled
      58
      wells (11 related to the Will-Drill acquisition) with a success rate of
      93%. 

Fiscal
      2005 revenues   and
      operating income decreased $23.2 million and $24.7 million, respectively,
      compared with fiscal 2004 due mainly to lower production volumes and oil and
      gas
      hedge ineffectiveness ($8.4 million). Hedge ineffectiveness was primarily due
      to
      the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the price differentials between
      NYMEX and field prices. On an equivalent basis, average daily production volumes
      declined 12% compared to the prior year due to well performance, rig
      availability, and other timing delays. Increases in lease operating expense
      ($3.7 million) and lower equity investment income from the Company s investment
      in EnerVest ($1.3 million), higher production taxes (associated with higher
      wellhead gas prices) and administrative costs ($1.5 million) also reduced
      operating income comparisons to fiscal 2004. These negative impacts on operating
      income were partially offset by lower DD A expense ($1.6 million) and lower
      exploration expense ($5.1 million) compared to the previous year. 

The
      following table summarizes hedges in place as of October 1, 2007 for the Oil
      and
      Gas Production segment.

          - 

The
      following table summarizes operating statistics from the Oil and Gas Production
      segment. 

Due
      to
  higher
      market prices and lower hedge percentages, net realized prices increased in
      fiscal 2006. The increase in the 2006 DD A rate was caused by production mix
      and the addition of unproven capital and costs associated with the development
      of both proven and unproven reserves.  

On
      February 23, 2006 the Company announced that it had acquired certain oil and
      gas
      properties in eastern Texas, northern Louisiana and Mississippi from Will-Drill
      for approximately $139 million. The acquired properties, virtually all of which
      are now operated by the Company, consist of approximately 60,000 gross acres
      in
      33 fields in the heart of the Cotton Valley / Travis Peak (Hosston) gas trend.
      The acquisition initially added approximately 7.5 MMcfed to existing production
      and an estimated 59 Bcfe of proven reserves. Approximately 47% of the acquired
      reserves are developed. The Will-Drill acquisition added 4.8 MMcfed to the
      annual average production. The Company expects to spend approximately $60
      million of drilling capital on the acquired properties in fiscal
      2007. 

During
      April 2005, the Company acquired properties in South Texas for approximately
      $6
      million. Although there was minimal production at the time of acquisition,
      these
      properties are providing current and future drilling opportunities. 

On
      July
      30, 2004, the Company acquired certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas
      from a private entity for approximately $10 million. Initial development of
      the
      acquired reserves began in fiscal 2005 with capital spending on these properties
      totaling $19.8 million. The acquired properties, which are operated by the
      Company, are located in close proximity to the existing Peoples Energy
      Production holdings in eastern Texas. On December 31, 2003, the Company
      acquired, through a series of transactions, certain oil and gas properties
      located in Texas for approximately $33.1 million. The acquired reserves, 88%
      of
      which are natural gas, contributed approximately 3.3 MMcfe per day of production
      to the Company s fiscal 2004 production. The majority of the acquired properties
      are located adjacent to or in close proximity to existing holdings of the
      Company, and each of the acquired properties is operated by the
      Company. 

Energy
      Marketing Segment.    Revenues
      for fiscal 2006 increased $155.2 million, primarily due to higher commodity
      prices, partially offset by a decline in gas volumes sold. Operating income
      for
      fiscal 2006 was $9.0 million compared to $13.5 million in fiscal 2005. Energy
      Marketing s margins can be volatile and are small in relation to the market
      value of the commodity. As a result, revenue statistics are not necessarily
      indicative of Energy Marketing operating income results. Retail results declined
      from a year ago due primarily to LOCOM and MTM accounting adjustments of energy
      contracts, the impact of which was magnified by a significant decline in the
      market price of natural gas during the latter half of September 2006, as well
      as
      higher operating expenses, partially due to higher sales and marketing expenses
      associated with customer growth. Lower retail results were  

-
          39
          - 

partially
      offset by higher wholesale marketing results, reflecting additional pipeline
      and
      storage capacity under contract and the positive impact of price volatility
      and
      spreads on storage and transportation optimization strategies, partially offset
      by LOCOM adjustments and MTM accounting. For the year, the number of retail
      customers increased approximately 60% from a year ago, to almost 41,000, as
      Energy Marketing expanded its customer base in Michigan and Ohio. Retail gas
      deliveries declined slightly to 48 Bcf, while electric deliveries increased
      24%
      to 1.7 million Mwh from 1.4 million Mwh a year ago. LOCOM inventory loss
      adjustments ($16.3 million), fair value hedge accounting losses ($3.2 million),
      ineffectiveness gains ($0.6 million) and MTM accounting gains ($1.3 million)
      resulted in an unrealized loss for the Energy Marketing segment of $17.6 million
      for fiscal 2006. This net unrealized loss includes both MTM activity of hedges
      for settlement in future periods and settled within the current period, as
      well
      as LOCOM inventory loss adjustments that are expected to reverse when the gas
      inventory is sold pursuant to existing contracts. Approximately $15 million
      of
      the year-end impact (net) is expected to reverse over the course of the next
      fiscal year and relates primarily to the LOCOM adjustment of $16.3 million.
      The
      earnings variability resulting from accounting timing can be significant from
      period to period, even when the underlying economic position is
      unchanged. 

The
      Company uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially
      lock
      in the profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes
      are
      withdrawn from storage. Under fair value hedge accounting, which Energy
      Marketing is using for certain storage activity, the MTM adjustment to inventory
      is computed using spot prices, while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk
      of changes in inventory value are marked-to-market using forward prices. When
      the spot price of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price,
      the difference is recorded in operating results. As a result, earnings are
      subject to volatility, even when the underlying expected profit margin over
      the
      duration of the contracts is unchanged. The volatility resulting from this
      accounting can be significant from period to period. 

Revenues
      for fiscal 2005 increased $173.7 million primarily due to higher retail and
      wholesale commodity prices and volumes. Operating income improved $3.6 million,
      driven by higher retail margins, higher load and lower operating costs,
      partially offset by a $3.3 million MTM loss related to the application of fair
      value hedge accounting to certain storage inventory transactions.  

The
      following table summarizes operating statistics for the Energy Marketing
      segment. 

Energy
      Assets Segment.      All
      financial results relating to power generation formerly included in this
      business segment are now reported as discontinued operations, including prior
      year results. Operating income for the Energy Assets segment reflects the
      Company s natural gas liquids (NGL) peaking facility, a 40 mile refinery gas
      pipeline, 250 acres of land and related facilities, and certain limited business
      development expenses related to ongoing asset investment
      opportunities. 

Revenues
      for   fiscal
      2006 increased $4.1 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices and
      increased volumes associated with activity at the Company s propane-based
      peaking facility. Fiscal 2006 operating income of $1.8 million was flat compared
      to fiscal 2005. 

Discontinued
      Operations.   
      The
      Company announced in February 2006 its intention to exit the power generation
      business. On January 31, 2006, the Company sold its 100% interest in the
      Valencia Energy power development site in New Mexico. On May 31, 2006, the
      Company completed the sale of its 27% interest in the SCEP facility to Exelon
      Generation Company, LLC. On September 20, 2006, the Company announced that
      it
      signed an agreement  

-
          40
          - 

with
      J-Power to sell its 50% interest in the Elwood power generation facility and
      its
      100% interest in a fully-permitted power development site, the COB Energy
      Facility (COB), for $110 million, subject to certain closing adjustments. These
      sales will complete the divestiture of substantially all power assets owned
      by
      Peoples Energy. The Board of Directors of J-Power's parent company approved
      the
      transactions on November 30, 2006. Financial results for power generation are
      now being reported by Peoples Energy as discontinued operations. Through Elwood
      and COB, the Company owned approximately 700 net Megawatts of power generation
      assets. 

Fiscal
      2006 income from discontinued operations for the Energy Assets segment decreased
      $1.6 million (before taxes) due to the absence of equity investment income
      from
      SCEP and the $1.8 million loss on the sale of the Valencia development site,
      partially offset by the $4.1 million gain on the sale of SCEP. Amortization
      of
      capitalized interest related to the construction of the Elwood power generation
      facility was formerly included in the Corporate and Other segment. 

Fiscal
      2005 income from discontinued operations for the Energy Assets segment increased
      $7.4 million (before taxes) from the prior year largely as a result of lower
      depreciation expense impact on equity investment income for the Elwood facility
      and lower other expenses. In connection with its fiscal 2004 year-end audit,
      the
      Elwood partnership determined that depreciation expense related to current
      and
      prior periods should be adjusted, primarily to recognize greater salvage value
      of its generating equipment. This adjustment positively impacted fiscal 2005
      results by $4.1 million, of which $2.2 million related to prior
      periods. 

The
      electric capacity of Elwood Energy LLC (Elwood) has been sold through long-term
      contracts with Exelon Generation Company, LLC (Exelon), Engage Energy America
      LLC (Engage) and Aquila, Inc. (Aquila). Effective December 31, 2004, the
      contract with Engage terminated and the related electric capacity is being
      purchased by Exelon. On June 15, 2006, Aquila assigned its Elwood power sales
      agreement to Constellation Energy Commodities Group, Inc, a subsidiary of
      Constellation Energy Group, Inc. In August 2006, S P and Moody s ratings on
      Elwood s bonds were upgraded to BB- and Ba1, respectively, with a stable
      outlook. 

Corporate
      and Other Segment.    The
      operating loss for fiscal 2006 increased $7.3 million and includes $8.9 of
      merger-related expenses. Results for fiscal 2005 included $13.1 million in
      restructuring charges. Absent these costs, corporate and other expenses
      increased $11.5 million due primarily to a $6.8 million gain in fiscal 2005
      associated with the sale of certain assets by Trigen-Peoples District Energy
      (of
      which Peoples Energy owned a 50% interest) and higher legal ($2.4 million)
      and
      incentive benefit expenses ($3.4 million). 

The
      operating loss for fiscal 2005 decreased $21.2 million primarily due to direct
      labor savings of $6.8 million as a result of the restructuring, the $6.8 million
      gain resulting from the sale of the Trigen-Peoples  district heating and cooling
      plant, and a $3.9 million decrease in costs resulting from the 2004
      organizational restructuring. 

Critical
      Accounting Policies   

      In
      preparing the Company s financial statements using GAAP, management exercises
      judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles, including
      making estimates and assumptions. Management considers its critical accounting
      policies to be those that are important to the representation of the Company s
      financial condition and results of operations. They require management s most
      difficult and subjective or complex judgments, including those that could result
      in materially different amounts if the Company reported under different
      conditions or using different assumptions. The Company discusses its critical
      accounting policies, as well as other accounting policies, with senior members
      of management and the Audit Committee, as appropriate. There were no material
      changes in the application of each of the critical accounting policies listed
      below during fiscal 2006. (See Note 2O of the Notes to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.)

Regulated
      Operations.   
      Due to
      the regulation of the Company s utility subsidiaries, certain transactions are
      recorded based on the accounting prescribed in SFAS No. 71. Regulatory assets
      represent probable future revenue associated with certain incurred costs that
      will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory
      liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to
      customers. Accordingly, actions of the Commission could have an effect on the
      amount recovered from or refunded to customers. Any  

-
          41
          - 

differences
      between recoverable and refundable amounts and the amounts deferred would be
      recorded as income or expense at the time of any Commission action (see Notes
      2C
      and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion
      of
      the gas charge settlement). If all or a reportable portion of the utility
      operations becomes no longer subject to the provision of SFAS No. 71, a
      write-off of related regulatory assets or liabilities would be required, unless
      some form of transition cost recovery continued through rates established and
      collected for the remaining regulated operations. No such change is foreseen
      by
      management. (See Note 2K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
      for a
      summary of regulatory assets and liabilities recorded under this
      policy.) 

Environmental
      Activities Relating to Former Manufactured Gas Operations.    The
      Company s utility subsidiaries, their predecessors, and certain former
      affiliates operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose
      of
      manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas (manufactured gas sites). The
      utility subsidiaries are accruing and deferring the costs they incur in
      connection with environmental activities at the manufactured gas sites pending
      recovery through rates or from other entities. The amounts deferred include
      costs incurred but not yet recovered through rates and management s best
      estimates of the costs that the utilities will incur in investigating and
      remediating the manufactured gas sites. Management s estimates are based upon a
      probabilistic model and an ongoing review by management of future investigative
      and remedial costs. 

Management
      considers this policy critical due to the substantial uncertainty in the
      estimation of future costs with respect to the amount and timing of costs,
      and
      the extent of recovery from other PRPs. (See Notes 2K and 7 of the Notes to
      Consolidated Financial Statements for deferred environmental costs recorded
      as
      regulatory assets and a discussion of environmental matters.) 

Retirement
      and Postretirement Benefits.   
      The
      calculation of pension expense relies on actuarial assumptions including
      discount rate, long-term rate of return on assets and assumed future increases
      in compensation. These assumptions are determined annually and changes to the
      assumptions can have a material effect on the amounts recorded from year to
      year. The Company bases its discount rate assumption on yields of high quality
      long-term, fixed-income bonds. A decrease in the assumed discount rate of 25
      basis points would have increased fiscal 2006 pension expense by $1.3
      million. 

Additionally,
      when an employee retires and takes his/her retirement benefit as a lump sum,
      a
      settlement amount under SFAS No. 88 is calculated representing a portion of
      unrecognized gains and losses. The Company has chosen to record this amount
      in
      the current period instead of amortizing the difference over the expected
      average service life of the remaining participants. Both methods are acceptable
      under GAAP. Therefore, the timing of retirements can have an effect on the
      amount recorded in any given year. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements for current year assumptions.) 

In
      addition, the Company and its subsidiaries currently provide certain health
      care
      and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all employees
      may become eligible for such benefit coverage if they reach retirement age
      while
      working for the Company. Through the use of an independent actuary, the Company
      accrues the expected costs of such benefits during a portion of the employees 
years of service. This accrual is based on assumptions regarding discount rates,
      rate of return on assets and health care cost trend rates. The health care
      cost
      trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
      Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
      for
      each future year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit
      obligation at September 30, 2006, by $12.9 million and the aggregate of service
      and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost
      by
      $2.1 million annually. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
      one
      percentage point for each future year would have decreased the accumulated
      postretirement benefit obligation at September 30, 2006, by $11.2 million and
      the aggregate of service and interest cost components of the net periodic
      postretirement benefit cost by $1.7 million annually. A decrease in the assumed
      discount rate of 25 basis points would have increased postretirement benefit
      cost expense by $0.4 million. (See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements for current year assumptions.) 

Derivative
      Instruments and Hedging Activities.   
      The
      Company enters into financial derivative contracts to hedge price risk on
      natural gas and oil purchases and sales. For each contract, management must
      determine whether the underlying transaction qualifies as a hedge under
      derivative accounting rules prescribed in SFAS No.  

-
          42
          - 

133.
      If
      contracts do qualify as hedges, they have the effect of reducing, but not
      completely eliminating, volatility in earnings. For contracts not qualifying
      as
      hedges, the change in the fair value of these contracts is recorded in income
      monthly and results in potentially significant impacts, both positive and
      negative. Additionally, due to the nature of the Company s businesses, many of
      the Company s contracts for physical purchases and sales of gas, oil or power
      meet the definition of a derivative, but are exempt from derivative accounting
      requirements under the normal purchases and sales exemption. Under this
      exemption, if the transactions are clearly intended to meet the requirements
      of
      customers, MTM accounting is not required. Management judgment is required
      to
      make this determination. The application of hedge accounting and the normal
      purchase and sales exemption is also subject to contemporaneous documentation
      requirements under SFAS No. 133. The Company also manages its levels of floating
      and fixed rate interest payments within a specified range through the use of
      derivative financial instruments. (See Note 2L of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s cash flow and fair
      value hedging strategies and the MTM derivative instruments.) 

Provision
      for Uncollectible Accounts.    The
      Company s subsidiaries accrue for estimated uncollectible accounts as revenues
      are recorded. The accrual rates are established based upon historical experience
      and projections of future charge-offs resulting from various factors, including
      the impacts of natural gas prices and weather. Each quarter, the Company s
      subsidiaries update the projection of future charge-offs based upon the most
      current information available, and adjust the reserve for uncollectible
      accounts, if necessary. 

Depreciation,
      depletion and amortization.   
      The
      Company s provision for depreciation at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas
      substantially reflects the systematic amortization of the original cost of
      depreciable property, net of the accumulated reserve for depreciation, over
      the
      estimated composite remaining useful lives on the straight-line method.
      Additionally, actual dismantling cost, net of salvage, is recorded as
      depreciation expense in the month incurred. The depreciation rates of Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas are subject to periodic review by the Commission, which
      approves the depreciation rates used for rate-making purposes. Diversified
      businesses  depreciable properties, other than oil and gas producing properties,
      are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  

In
      the
      case of oil and gas producing properties, the Company is amortizing associated
      capitalized costs by utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting
      on
      the units-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves.
      The successful efforts method provides for properties to be aggregated into
      cost
      centers, or  pools , with depreciation, depletion and amortization calculated on
      a pool- by- pool basis. These pools are comprised of properties in an area
      that
      share the same general geological characteristics. Unit of production
      amortization rates and the aggregation of properties into pools are reviewed
      at
      least once a year or whenever there is an indication of the need for revision.
      Those revisions are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting
      estimates. Acquisition costs are amortized over total proved reserves.
      Development costs are amortized over total proved developed reserves. Costs
      to
      be amortized include all capitalized costs (less accumulated amortization)
      and
      estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage. The
      cost of investments in unproved properties and major development projects are
      excluded from the amortization base. These costs and resulting proved reserves
      are transferred into the amortization base or expensed at the point when a
      determination can be made about the project s success. (See Note 19 of the Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements for supplemental disclosures of the
      Company s Oil and Gas Production segment.)

LIQUIDITY
      AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The
      following is a summary of cash flows for the Company: 

Cash
      provided by operating activities for fiscal 2006 decreased as compared to fiscal
      2005, primarily due to the decrease in net income resulting from the impact
      of
      the gas charge settlement refund (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated
      Financial Statements) and other factors described above under  Results of
      Operations,  partially offset by favorable net changes in working capital. In
      the accompanying cash flow statements, balance sheet changes in current deferred
      tax assets, gas in storage and deposits with broker or trustee exclude certain
      noncash transactions (primarily the effects of MTM accounting). Changes in
      gas
      in storage reflect lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments. Additionally, balance
      sheet changes in intercompany assets/liabilities of Peoples Gas and North Shore
      Gas exclude the noncash effects of derivative activity conducted on their behalf
      by Peoples Energy. Net cash used in investing activities increased as a result
      of an increase in capital spending, primarily in the Oil and Gas Production
      segment. On February 23, 2006, the Company announced that it had acquired
      certain oil and gas properties in eastern Texas, northern Louisiana and
      Mississippi from Will-Drill for approximately $139 million. Increases in the
      return of capital from the Company's equity method investments, primarily
      related to the sale of properties by the EnerVest partnership and the
      Trigen-Peoples partnership, as well as through the sale of the Company s
      interest in the SCEP facility which resulted in proceeds of approximately
      $47 million, were largely offset by an increase in deposits associated with
      the
      Company s commodity hedging activities. Net cash provided by financing
      activities increased primarily due to additional commercial paper borrowing
      ($301.6 million) in fiscal 2006, partially related to the Oil and Gas Production
      segment acquisition, compared to commercial paper retirement ($47.5 million)
      in
      fiscal 2005. 

Cash
      provided by operating activities for fiscal 2005 increased due to favorable
      net
      changes in working capital. Net cash used in investing activities in fiscal
      2005
      decreased compared to 2004 as a result of decreased capital spending primarily
      in the Oil and Gas Production segment offset by an increase in deposits
      associated with the Company's commodity hedging activities driven by price
      declines and ratings downgrades on Company long-term debt. The increase in
      net
      cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily
      due to increased retirements of commercial paper, lower amounts of debt issued
      (net of retirements) and to lower amounts of common stock issued under the
      continuous equity program and the LTIC Plan in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal
      2004. 

See
      the
      Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the discussion of major balance sheet
      variations below for more detail. 

Balance
      Sheet Variations  

      Total
      assets at September 30, 2006, increased $284.6 million as compared to September
      30, 2005, due to additional capital investment in the Oil and Gas Production
      segment resulting from the Will-Drill acquisition, increases in current
      regulatory assets related primarily to MTM accounting for the utility gas costs
      hedging program, and increases in noncurrent regulatory assets and capital
      investments in the Gas Distribution segment resulting from the recognition
      of
      asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47. These increases were
      partially offset by decreases in derivative assets that are marked-to-market
      and
      largely relate to utility hedge activity. The decrease in derivative assets
      reflects price declines during fiscal 2006 relative to utility supply contracts
      (long positions). Current liabilities increased due to additional levels of
      commercial paper outstanding (primarily due to the oil and gas properties
      acquisition) and an increase in gas costs refundable through rate adjustments,
      partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes due to lower taxable
      income and by a decrease in regulatory liabilities largely corresponding
      with the above decrease in derivative assets that are marked-to-market.

-
          44
          - 

Settlement
      of these assets is included as an adjustment to gas costs included in customer
      bills. Deferred credits and other liabilities increased due to the recognition
      of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47. The increase in the
      Company's capitalization was the result of the combined decrease in the
      accumulated other comprehensive loss and increase in common stock (primarily
      issued through the Direct Purchase and Investment Plan and the LTIC Plans),
      partially offset by the reduction in retained earnings, due primarily to the
      $64.7 million after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement and dividend
      payments of $83.7 million. The decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive
      loss reflects both price declines related to short position derivatives
      accounted for as cash flow hedges at the Company's Oil and Gas Production and
      Energy Marketing segments and a net decrease in derivative positions at the
      Oil
      and Gas Production segment. 

Financial
      Sources  

      The
      Company and Peoples Gas have access to outside capital markets, commercial
      paper
      markets and internal sources of funds that together provide sufficient resources
      to meet their working capital and long-term capital requirements. North Shore
      Gas has access to outside capital markets to meet long-term capital requirements
      and uses internal sources of funds and loans from the Company and Peoples Gas
      to
      meet working capital needs. Changes that could materially alter its liquidity
      position include the effect of high gas prices on utility working capital and
      on
      hedge-related margin requirements for the upcoming heating season. 

The
      Company maintains lines of credit facilities to ensure sufficient liquidity
      for
      seasonal working capital requirements and other short-term financial needs.
      As
      forecasts of liquidity change throughout the year (due to high gas prices,
      for
      example), the Company may seek additional sources of liquidity in order to
      meet
      its objectives. 

Due
      to
      the seasonal nature of gas usage, a major portion of the utilities  cash
      collections occurs between January and June. Because of timing differences
      in
      the receipt and disbursement of cash and the level of construction requirements,
      the utility subsidiaries borrow from time to time on a short-term basis.
      Short-term borrowings are repaid with cash from operations or other short-term
      borrowings or are refinanced on a permanent basis with debt or equity, depending
      on market conditions and capital structure considerations. 

In
      addition to cash generated internally by operations, as of September 30,
      2006, the Company and its subsidiaries had committed credit facilities of
      $650 million (Peoples Energy, $400 million; Peoples Gas,
      $250 million). These facilities primarily support the Company s and Peoples
      Gas  ability to borrow using commercial paper. As of September 30, 2006,
      $89.6 million of Peoples Energy s $400 million line and all of Peoples
      Gas  $250 million facilities were available. The Peoples Energy
      $400 million credit agreement expires in June 2011, and the Peoples Gas
      $250 million credit agreement expires in July 2010. The long-term credit
      facilities are expected to be renewed when they expire, although the exact
      amount of the renewals will be evaluated at that time and may change from the
      current levels. North Shore Gas intends to meet its future short term borrowing
      requirements through loans from Peoples Energy or Peoples Gas.  

The
      Company s and Peoples Gas  credit facilities generally contain debt triggers
      that permit the lenders to terminate the credit commitments to the borrowing
      company and declare any outstanding amounts due and payable if the borrowing
      company s consolidated debt-to-total capital ratio, excluding the impact of
      accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), exceeds 65%. At
      September 30, 2006, the Company s total debt was 59% of total debt plus
      equity (58% excluding AOCI), up from 53% a year ago due primarily to the impacts
      of the settlement charge and the Will-Drill oil and gas acquisition. Anticipated
      proceeds from the sale of the Company s remaining power generation assets by
      calendar year end will be used to reduce short-term borrowing. The current
      debt-to-total capital ratio for Peoples Gas is 44% (44% excluding AOCI).
      Management does not expect the gas reconciliation settlement to have a material
      adverse affect on the Company's liquidity or its ability to fund its strategic
      initiatives and capital expenditures. 

In
      addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, the Company has
      uncommitted lines of credit and letters of credit backup of $25.0 million,
      of
      which $2.0 million was used for letters of credit backup and $23.0 million
      was
      unused as of September 30, 2006. Peoples Gas and North Shore have the
      ability to loan up to  

-
          45
          - 

$50 million
      between the two utilities and to borrow up to $150 million and $50 million,
      respectively, from Peoples Energy. As of September 30, 2006, there were no
      loans from Peoples Energy to Peoples Gas or North Shore Gas. As of
      September 30, 2006, there were no loans between Peoples Gas and North Shore
      Gas.

Changes
      in Credit Lines and Debt Securities  

      On
      October 20, 2006, the Company entered into (1) a $25 million revolving credit
      agreement with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V.; (2) a $25 million revolving credit agreement
      with Bank of America, N.A.; and (3) a $25 million revolving credit agreement
      with JPMorgan Chase Bank to provide for potential seasonal liquidity needs.
      Each
      credit agreement is effective from October 20, 2006 through the earlier of
      (i)
      March 31, 2007 or (ii) the consummation of the merger between a subsidiary
      of
      WPS Resources Corporation and Peoples Energy. Funds may be used for general
      corporate purposes and commercial paper back-up. 

On
      June
      13, 2006, the Company and various institutions entered into a $400 million
      5-year syndicated revolving credit agreement. The credit agreement is effective
      through June 13, 2011 and funds may be used for general corporate purposes.
      The
      credit agreement supports the Company's commercial paper borrowing program.
      This
      credit agreement replaces the previous $225 million credit facility dated
      March 8, 2004 that was scheduled to expire in March 2007.  

On
      July 12, 2005, Peoples Gas entered into a 5-year syndicated revolving
      credit agreement with eleven financial institutions that provides backup for
      Peoples Gas  seasonal commercial paper borrowing program. The maximum amount
      that may be borrowed under the credit agreement is $250 million. This
      replaces the previous $200 million credit facility that was scheduled to
      expire in August 2005. 

During
      fiscal 2005 the Company refinanced $50 million of Peoples Gas debt. (See
      Note 14A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of
      fiscal 2005 s refinancing activity.) 

Changes
      in Equity Securities  

      The
      Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for
      the issuance from time to time of up to 1.5 million shares of common stock
      pursuant to a continuous equity offering in one or more negotiated transactions
      or  at-the-market  offerings. As of September 30, 2006, a total of
      1,235,700 shares of common stock had been issued through the continuous
      equity offering. In fiscal 2004, 377,400 shares were issued, resulting in
      proceeds of $15.5 million, net of issuance costs. During fiscal 2005 and 2006
      and through the date of filing the Company s Form 10-K with the SEC, the
      Company has not issued any additional shares under this registration

-
          46
          - 

statement.
      However, the Company did issue common stock through its LTIC Plan, Direct
      Purchase and Investment Plan, DDC Plan, DSOP and its ESPP. (See Note 17 of
      the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

During
      fiscal 2006, Peoples Gas issued 540,000 shares of its common stock to the
      Company for $53.9 million.  

Financial
      Uses  

       Capital
      Spending   .
      In
      fiscal 2006, the Company's capital expenditures totaled $344.0 million,
      including $0.6 million related to assets of discontinued operations. The Gas
      Distribution segment spent $101.6 million on property, plant and equipment,
      of
      which $92.2 million related to Peoples Gas and $9.4 million to North Shore
      Gas.
      Capital expenditures at the Oil and Gas Production segment on the acquisition
      of
      reserves, drilling projects and the exploitation of the acquired and existing
      assets totaled $236.4 million. Management currently estimates that capital
      spending for fiscal 2007 will total approximately $250 million. 

Dividends   .
      The
      Company's dividends have not changed since February 4, 2005, when the Company's
      Board of Directors voted to raise the regular quarterly dividend on the
      Company's common stock from 54 cents per share to 54 1/2 cents per share. The
      first payment at this new level was made on April 15, 2005, to shareholders
      of
      record at the close of business on March 22, 2005. 

Interest
      Coverage  

      The
      fixed
      charges coverage ratios for the Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are
      as
      follows: 

The
      decrease in the ratio for the Company in fiscal 2006 from 2005 reflects higher
      interest rates, lower pretax income, due primarily to the settlement charge
      in
      fiscal 2006, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate
      adjustments. The decrease in the ratio in fiscal 2005 from 2004 reflects higher
      interest rates in fiscal 2005. 

The
      decrease in the ratio for Peoples Gas in fiscal 2006 from 2005 reflects higher
      interest rates, lower pretax income, due primarily to the settlement charge
      in
      fiscal 2006, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate
      adjustments. The decrease in the ratio in fiscal 2005 from 2004 reflects higher
      interest rates in fiscal 2005. 

The
      decrease in the ratio for North Shore Gas in fiscal 2006 from 2005 and 2004
      levels reflects lower pretax income, due primarily to the settlement charge
      in
      fiscal 2006, and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate
      adjustments. 

Commitments
      and Contractual Obligations   

       Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements.   
      Off-balance sheet debt at September 30, 2006 and 2005, consists of the Company's
      pro rata share of nonrecourse debt of various equity investments, including
      EnerVest (zero and $2.9 million) and Elwood ($165.1 million and $174.3 million).
      The Company believes this off-balance sheet financing will not have a material
      effect on the Company's future financial condition. The Company also has
      commercial obligations of $34.6 million in guarantees, $6.7 million in letters
      of credit, $1.6 million in surety bonds and $35.2 million in operating leases
      at
      September 30, 2006. (See Notes 5 and 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements for further descriptions and details of the Company s off-balance
      sheet arrangements.)  

-
          47
          - 

Contractual
      Obligations.    The
      Company has certain contractual obligations directly related to the Company s
      operations and unconsolidated equity investees. The majority of these are
      guarantees of debt service and performance (related to unconsolidated equity
      investees), as well as substantial commitments for gas supply, transportation
      and storage. (See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
      Statements.) 

The
      following table summarizes the Company s long-term minimum contractual
      obligations.  

(1)  
             
                Includes
                interest on fixed and adjustable rate debt. The adjustable rate interest
                is calculated based on the indexed rate in effect at September 30,
                2006. 

(2)  
             
                Includes
                gas purchases, storage, transportation, information technology-related
                and
                miscellaneous long-term and short-term capital   purchase
                commitments. 

(3)  
             
                Minimum
                pension funding is an estimate of the contributions that would be
                required
                pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security   Act
                to fund benefits earned as of October 1, 2006. Additional contributions
                may be made to fund benefits accruing after October 1, 2006, or
                  on
                a discretionary basis. 

Merger.
         In
      the
      event that the pending merger with WPS Resources is successfully completed,
      the
      Company will recognize expenses estimated to total approximately $14 million
      in
      addition to expenses recognized in fiscal 2006. These payments are for
      transaction fees and other costs, as well as additional compensation expense
      resulting from the change in control provisions in the Company s long-term
      incentive plans. (See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
      Statements.) Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements discusses
      the termination fees and related expenses in the event the merger is not
      completed. 

Environmental
      Matters   .
      Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas are conducting environmental investigations and remedial
      work at certain sites that were the locations of former manufactured gas
      operations. (See Note 7A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)
      North Shore Gas received a demand from a responsible party under CERCLA for
      environmental costs associated with a site in Denver, Colorado. (See Note 7B
      of
      the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

Gas
      Charge Reconciliation Proceedings and Related Matters.   
      For each
      utility subsidiary, the Commission conducts annual proceedings regarding the
      reconciliation of revenues from the Gas Charge and related gas costs. In these
      proceedings, the accuracy of the reconciliation of revenues and costs is
      reviewed and the prudence of gas costs recovered through the Gas Charge is
      examined by interested parties. On March 21, 2005, the Illinois Attorney General
      (AG) and Chicago filed lawsuits against the Company and several of its
      subsidiaries alleging violations against its customers under certain state
      and
      city consumer fraud laws, respectively. On March 28, 2006, the Commission issued
      an order approving a settlement that resolved Peoples Gas' and North Shore
      Gas'
      fiscal 2001 - 2004 gas charge cases and the AG and Chicago lawsuits. (See Note
      8A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

In
      February 2004, a purported class action was filed against the Company and
      Peoples Gas by a Peoples Gas customer alleging, among other things, violation
      of
      the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act related to
      maters at issue in Peoples Gas' gas charge reconciliation proceedings. (See
      Note
  8B
      of the
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)

Indenture
      Restrictions   

      North
      Shore Gas  indenture relating to its first mortgage bonds contains provisions
      and covenants restricting the payment of cash dividends and the purchase or
      redemption of capital stock. At September 30, 2006, such restrictions
      amounted to $6.9 million of North Shore Gas  total retained earnings of
      $  76.3 million. 

Peoples
      Energy Resources owns a 50% equity interest in Elwood. Elwood's trust indenture
      and other agreements related to its project financing prohibit Elwood from
      making distributions unless Elwood has maintained certain minimum historic
      and
      projected debt service coverage ratios. At July 5, 2006, a minimum debt service
      coverage ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 was required to make a cash distribution and
      Elwood's actual debt service coverage ratio was approximately 1.4 to
      1.0. 

PEOPLES
      GAS AND NORTH SHORE GAS DISCUSSIONS  

The
      financial results of Peoples Gas (including its hub operations) and North Shore
      Gas are reported primarily within the Gas Distribution segment. Operating income
      (GAAP) and ongoing operating income (non-GAAP) by business segment for Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas is presented below. 

(1) 

Fiscal
                2006 ongoing operating income (non-GAAP) is defined as GAAP operating
                (loss) adjusted to exclude the effects of a charge of $103.0 million
                and
                $4.3 million at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, respectively, associated
                with the settlement of gas charge proceedings. Fiscal 2005 ongoing
                operating income (non-GAAP) is defined as GAAP operating income adjusted
                to exclude the effects of pension expense related restructuring costs
                of
                $8.8 million and $0.6 million at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas,
                respectively. Fiscal 2004 ongoing operating income (non-GAAP) is
                defined
                as GAAP operating income adjusted to exclude the effects of pension
                expense related restructuring costs of $9.7 million and $0.9 million
                at
                Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, respectively. See Item 7 - MD A -
                Executive Summary for a discussion of management's use of non-GAAP
                financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP
                earnings.    

The
      following discussions supplement Peoples Gas' and North Shore Gas' information
      included in Liquidity and Capital Resources and in the Company's Gas
      Distribution segment discussion within this MD A. 

Peoples
      Gas Discussion   

      GAAP
      net
      loss for Peoples Gas for fiscal 2006 was $35.4 million compared to net income
      of
      $49.3 million in fiscal 2005. Excluding the charge related to the settlement
      of
      gas charge proceedings ($62.1 million, after tax), ongoing net income (non-GAAP)
      was $26.6 million. Excluding pension-related charges ($5.3 million, after tax)
      resulting from the fiscal year 2004 organizational restructuring, ongoing net
      income (non-GAAP) for fiscal 2005 was $54.6 million. 

Revenues
      for fiscal 2006 increased $197.6 million compared with fiscal 2005. These
      results were due to the impact on revenues of changes in gas prices (an increase
      of $270 million) that are recovered on a dollar-for-dollar basis. These results
      also reflected the impact on revenues of decreased deliveries due to weather
      ($16 million) that was 2% warmer compared with the prior year,   lower
      weather-normalized demand ($88 million) and the impact of the change in the
      regulatory treatment of Hub revenues ($10.7 million) due to the gas charge
      settlement agreement. The $135.7 million decrease in operating income for fiscal
      2006 was primarily due to the $103.0 million charge related to the amended
      settlement of the gas charge proceedings, higher operation and maintenance

-
          49
          - 

expense
      ($21.0 million), the change in treatment of Hub revenues ($10.7 million), lower
      deliveries resulting from warmer weather ($2 million) and lower normalized
      deliveries ($8 million). The increase in operation and maintenance expense
      was
      due to higher labor, pension, group insurance, bad debt, outside services and
      rate case expenses. These increases were partially offset by the impact of
      the
      fiscal 2005 restructuring-related pension charge of $8.8 million. 

Interest
      expense for Peoples Gas for fiscal 2006 increased $3.2 million due to higher
      interest rates and an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through
      rate
      adjustments. 

Fiscal
      2005 revenues for Peoples Gas increased $145.3 million from the previous period.
      The main reason for the increase was the impact on revenues of higher gas prices
      ($179 million). Partially offsetting these effects were lower revenues resulting
      from a decrease in deliveries due to weather ($27 million) that was 4% warmer
      than the previous period and a decrease in normalized deliveries. GAAP operating
      income increased $7.8 million from fiscal 2004. Operating income was favorably
      impacted by decreased labor costs related to the organizational restructuring
      ($8.6 million) and a decrease in depreciation expense ($5.7 million) primarily
      due to the Commission Depreciation Order. Negative impacts on 2005 results
      include lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather ($4.5
      million). 

Fiscal
      2005 interest expense for Peoples Gas increased $2.7 million over fiscal 2004
      primarily due to higher interest rates.  

Total
      assets at September 30, 2006 increased $135.7 million compared to September
      30, 2005 due primarily to an increase in current regulatory assets related
      to
      MTM accounting for the utility gas costs hedging program, an increase in
      noncurrent regulatory assets and capital investments related to the recognition
      of asset retirement obligations required under FIN 47, an increase in cash
      and
      cash equivalents, an increase in gas in storage (due to higher prices and
      volume), and an increase in prepaid pension costs (due to the elimination of
      the
      additional minimum pension liability as a result of increased plan funding
      and
      an increase in the discount rate). These increases were partially offset by
      a
      decrease in intercompany receivables due to of a decrease in derivative assets
      contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf of Peoples Gas that are marked-to-market.
      The decrease in derivative assets reflects price declines during fiscal 2006
      relative to utility supply contracts (long positions). The increase in current
      liabilities was driven by an increase in intercompany payables (made up largely
      of unrealized losses on derivatives contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf
      of
      Peoples Gas that are marked-to-market) and increases in gas costs refundable
      through rate adjustments. These increases were partially offset by a decrease
      in
      current regulatory liabilities. The decrease in current regulatory liabilities
      largely corresponds with above decrease in derivative assets that are
      marked-to-market. Settlement of these assets is included as an adjustment to
      gas
      costs included in customer bills. Deferred credits and other liabilities
      increased primarily due to the recognition of asset retirement obligations
      required under FIN 47, which largely correspond with the above increase in
      noncurrent regulatory assets. Peoples Gas  capitalization increased with a $53.9
      million equity contribution by the Company in Peoples Gas and a decrease in
      the
      accumulated other comprehensive loss. These increases were partially offset
      by
      the reduction in retained earnings due primarily to dividend payments of $15.4
      million and a $35.4 million fiscal 2006 net loss, which reflects the $62.1
      million after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement.

      GAAP
      net
      income for North Shore Gas for fiscal 2006 was $6.7 million compared to $11.4
      million in fiscal 2005. Excluding the net charge related to the settlement
      of
      gas charge proceedings ($2.6 million, after tax), ongoing net income (loss)
      (non-GAAP) was $9.3 million. Excluding pension-related charges ($0.4 million,
      after tax) resulting from the fiscal year 2004 organizational restructuring,
      ongoing net income (non-GAAP) for fiscal 2005 was $11.8 million. 

Revenues
      for North Shore Gas for fiscal 2006 increased $39.1 million compared to fiscal
      2005, mainly due to the impact on revenues of higher gas prices ($48 million),
      partially offset by the impact of decreased deliveries due to weather ($4
      million) that was 2% warmer compared with the same year ago period and lower
      weather-normalized demand ($11 million). Operating income decreased $7.7 million
      for fiscal 2006. Results were unfavorably

impacted
      by the net charge ($4.3 million) related to the amended settlement of the gas
      charge proceedings, lower deliveries resulting from warmer weather ($0.5
      million), lower normalized deliveries ($0.5 million), and higher operation
      and
      maintenance expenses     ($3.7
      million) which included $0.7 million of rate case costs, partially offset by
      the
      impact of the fiscal 2005 restructuring-related pension charge of $0.6
      million. 

Interest
      expense for North Shore Gas for fiscal 2006 increased $0.4 million primarily
      due
      to an increase in gas costs refundable to customers through rate
      adjustments. 

Fiscal
      2005 revenues for North Shore Gas increased $37.8 million over the prior period
      mainly due to the impact on revenues of higher gas prices ($42 million).
      Partially offsetting these effects were lower revenues resulting from a decrease
      in deliveries due to weather ($4 million) that was 4% warmer compared to the
      prior period. GAAP operating income for fiscal 2005 was flat compared to fiscal
      2004. The fiscal 2005 results were favorably impacted by a decrease in
      depreciation expense ($1.4 million) primarily due to the Commission Depreciation
      Order and negatively impacted by an increase in pension expense ($1.0 million).

Total
      assets at September 30, 2006 increased $28.8 million compared to September
      30, 2005 due to an increase in current regulatory assets related primarily
      to
      MTM accounting for the utility gas costs hedging program, an increase in
      noncurrent regulatory assets related to the recognition of asset retirement
      obligations required under FIN 47, and an increase in gas in storage. These
      increases were partially offset by a decrease in intercompany receivables made
      up largely of a decrease in derivative assets contracted by Peoples Energy
      on
      behalf of North Shore Gas that are marked-to-market. The decrease in derivative
      assets reflects price declines during fiscal 2006 relative to utility supply
      contracts (long positions). The increase in current liabilities was driven
      by an
      increase in intercompany payables (made up largely of unrealized losses on
      derivatives contracted by Peoples Energy on behalf of North Shore Gas that
      are
      marked-to-market) and an increase in gas costs refundable through rate
      adjustments. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in regulatory
      liabilities. The decrease in regulatory liabilities largely corresponds with
      the
      above decrease in derivative assets that are marked-to-market. Settlement of
      these assets is included as an adjustment to gas costs included in customer
      bills. The Company's capitalization decreased with the reduction in retained
      earnings due primarily to dividend payments of $11.0 million, partially offset
      by $6.7 million of net income, which was negatively affected by the $2.6 million
      after tax charge related to the gas charge settlement.

ITEM
      7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
      Risk   

      The
      Company is exposed to various business risks associated with commodity prices,
      weather, interest rates, and credit. These financial exposures are monitored
      and
      managed by the Company as an integral part of its overall risk management
      program. The Company s risk management program includes, among other things, the
      use of financial derivatives. 

Quantitative
      and qualitative disclosures about market risk are reported under Item 1A Risk
      Factors and below under Risk Management Activities. 

RISK
      MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES  

        Commodity
      Price Risk   

      The
      Company s earnings may vary due to changes in commodity prices (market risk)
      that affect its subsidiaries  operations and investments. To manage this market
      risk, the Company uses forward contracts and financial instruments, including
      commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. It is the policy of the Company
      to use these instruments solely for the purpose of managing risk and not for
      any
      speculative purpose. 

Derivative
      Summary.   
      The
      following table summarizes the changes in valuation of all outstanding
      derivative contracts during fiscal 2006 and 2005. All amounts are based on
      fair
      values at the end of the period and do not necessarily indicate that a gain
      or
      loss on the derivative will be recognized in income in future periods.
      Generally, hedges are held to maturity, which coincides with recognition of
      the
      transaction being hedged (e.g., anticipated sales or cost of purchases in
      income), thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the
      underlying risk management strategies.  

The
      change in the value of derivative contracts for the fiscal year ended September
      30, 2006 was due primarily to the dramatic change in the forward price curve
      of
      natural gas over this same period. The increase in the value of contracts
      designated as cash flow hedges was driven primarily by the effect of lower
      forward prices and a reduction of hedged volumes in the Oil and Gas Production
      segment s derivatives portfolio. The increase in the value of contracts
      designated as fair value hedges was driven primarily by an increase in value
      in
      the Energy Marketing segment s storage optimization portfolio, partially offset
      by the decrease in value of the Company s floating rate interest rate swap
      reflecting the rise in short term interest rates. The primary cause of the
      decrease in the value of contracts designated as MTM is attributable to the
      impact of the change in the forward price curve on the derivative instruments
      of
      Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas used to manage each utility s cost of gas
      supply. This was partially offset by the positive impact of changes in prices
      on
      MTM portfolios at the Energy Marketing segment. For the fiscal year ended
      September 30, 2006, unrealized losses on contracts attributed to Peoples Gas
      and
      North Shore Gas were $322 million and $61 million, respectively. SFAS No. 71
      allows for these MTM derivative gains and losses to be recorded as regulatory
      assets or regulatory liabilities. Realized gains and losses  

-
          54
          - 

are
      recorded as an adjustment to the cost of gas supply in the period that the
      underlying gas purchase transaction takes place. The costs and benefits of
      this
      activity are passed through to customers under the tariffs of Peoples Gas and
      North Shore Gas.  

The
      following table is a summary of the fair market value of commodity derivatives
      by type at September 30, 2006. Valuations are based on the NYMEX closing prices
      for the respective NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts and on the closing prices
      published in various commodity pricing publications for the geographical
      differential between a specific location price and the NYMEX Henry Hub futures
      contract closing price where applicable.

Cash
      Flow Hedges.    The
      Company has positions in oil and gas reserves, natural gas, and transportation
      as part of its Oil and Gas Production and Energy Marketing businesses, and
      related to its company use gas in the Gas Distribution segment. The Company
      uses
      derivative financial instruments to protect against loss of value of future
      anticipated cash transactions (sales and purchases) caused by changes in the
      marketplace. These instruments are designated cash flow hedges, which allow
      for
      the effective portion of unrealized changes in value during the life of the
      hedge to be recorded in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses
      from cash flow hedges are recorded in the statement of operations in the same
      month the related physical sales and purchases and interest expense are
      recorded. Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer
      probable that the original forecasted transactions will occur. The carrying
      value of contracts which no longer qualify for hedge accounting are
      prospectively marked-to-market, with the change in value recorded in the
      statement of operations. If the original forecasted transactions are probable
      of
      not occurring, any amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income
      are
      immediately recorded in the statement of operations. Hedge ineffectiveness
      can
      result from differences in critical terms (such as location) between the hedging
      instrument and the hedged transaction and result in the immediate recognition
      of
      gains or losses.  

Fair
      Value Hedges.   
      The
      Company uses financial and physical hedges to protect the value of a portion
      of
      Energy Marketing s gas in storage and these are accounted for as fair value
      hedges. The change in value of these hedges and the change in value of the
      inventory hedged are expected to largely offset in each reporting period in
      the
      statement of operations. During the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005,
      the
      Energy Marketing segment recorded MTM losses of $3.2 million and $3.3 million,
      respectively, related to the application of fair value hedge accounting to
      certain storage inventory transactions. The Energy Marketing segment uses
      derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially lock in the
      profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes are
      withdrawn from storage. Under fair value accounting, which is used for certain
      storage activity, the MTM adjustment to inventory is computed using spot prices,
      while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk of changes in inventory value
      are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price of natural gas
      changes disproportionately to the forward price, the difference is recorded
      in
      operating results. As a result, earnings are subject to volatility, even when
      the underlying expected profit margin over the duration of the contracts is
      unchanged. The volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant
      from
      period to period. A portion of this accounting loss will reverse next year
      if
      the volumes are withdrawn from storage. At September 30, 2006, gas inventory
      hedged using fair value accounting at Energy Marketing had a fair value of
      $18.0
      million, including MTM decreases in inventory totaling $16.8 million for changes
      in spot prices. Derivative assets totaling $10.3 million were recorded for
      the
      fair value of the derivatives used to hedge this inventory. At September 30,
      2005, hedged gas inventory at Energy Marketing had a fair value of $44.1
      million, including MTM increases in inventory totaling $17.6 million for changes
      in spot prices. Derivative liabilities totaling $20.9 million were recorded
      for
      the fair value of the derivatives used to hedge this inventory. 

The
      Company also uses certain financial instruments to adjust the portfolio
      composition of its debt from fixed-rate to floating-rate debt. These derivative
      instruments are accounted for as fair value hedges and are not material to
      the
      Company's financial condition or results of operations. The change in value
      of
      these hedges along with the offsetting change in value of the debt hedged (to
      the extent the hedge is effective) are recorded in each reporting period in
      interest expense in the statement of operations. 

Mark-To-Market
      Derivative Instruments.    Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas use derivative instruments to manage each utility s cost
      of gas supply and mitigate price volatility. All such derivative instruments
      are
      measured at fair value. The regulated utilities  tariffs allow for full recovery
      from their customers of prudently incurred gas supply costs, including gains
      or
      losses on these derivative instruments. As a result, SFAS No. 71 allows these
      MTM derivative gains or losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory
      liabilities. Realized gains or losses are recorded as an adjustment to the
      cost
      of gas supply in the period that the underlying gas purchase transaction takes
      place. The costs and benefits of this activity are passed through to customers
      under the tariffs of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.  

The
      Energy Marketing segment uses certain derivative contracts (such as NYMEX or
      Basis swaps) that do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133.
      Included in these contracts are hedges of location differentials associated
      with
      its wholesale natural gas contracts and transactions involving storage assets.
      In the fiscal year  

-
          57
          - 

ended
      September 30, 2006, the Energy Marketing segment recognized MTM pretax gains
      (losses) (included in revenues) of $1.3 million related to these derivatives.
      As
      physical volumes are delivered under natural gas contracts or withdrawn under
      certain gas storage contracts, these MTM accounting impacts are reversed. The
      above amounts include net MTM activity both for hedges for settlement in future
      periods and the reversal of amounts recorded in prior periods and settled within
      the current period. 

The
      following table summarizes the market value of these outstanding instruments
      and
      other derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and are
      recorded on a MTM basis. All amounts are expected to be settled during the
      next
      12 months. 

Weather
      Risk   

      The
      Company s Gas Distribution earnings vary due to the warmth or severity of the
      weather. The Company has managed this risk through the purchase of weather
      insurance and the use of block rates in utility rate design. Block rates help
      mitigate the effect of warm weather by allowing greater cost recovery on the
      first volumes through the meter and less on the last volumes. The insurance
      in
      place for fiscal 2005 was provided by a subsidiary of X.L. America, Inc. and
      protected the Company for a portion of lost revenue incurred when weather was
      more than 5% warmer than normal. In fiscal 2005 the Company recognized as
      additional revenues $3.5 million in insurance recoveries. No weather insurance
      was purchased for fiscal 2006 as the Company views the current market pricing
      for this product as excessive relative to the risk it would protect
      against. 

The
      Energy Marketing business segment can also be affected by weather variations.
      Storage, swing supply and weather derivatives are used or are available to
      protect earnings and ensure performance. 

Interest
      Rate Risk   

      The
      Company uses interest rate derivatives to adjust the portfolio composition
      of
      fixed-rate and floating rate debt and it accounts for these derivatives as
      fair
      value hedges.   In
      August
      2004, the Company entered into a six-month LIBOR-based interest rate swap
      agreement on $50.0 million of its $325.0 million 6.90% Series A
      Notes, due January 15, 2011. Under this agreement, the Company will receive
      the fixed price of 6.90% and pay six-month LIBOR plus a defined spread on the
      notional amount of $50.0 million. The payments will reset on the
      15th day of each January and July until maturity of the Series A
      Notes. 

Credit
      Risk   

      The
      Company has established a credit policy to mitigate the effect of nonperformance
      on wholesale transactions. Pursuant to this policy, a credit limit is
      established for all counterparties based on a review of their financial
      condition. The Company reviews, and changes when necessary, its credit
      underwriting and monitoring procedures. The Company has adequate financial
      assurance provisions in its commercial agreements that permit the Company to
      call for credit support when warranted. Action may include the calling of
      collateral, adjusting credit lines, changing payment terms or reducing future
      business. In addition, netting arrangements and requirements to post margin
      are
      used to further reduce credit exposure. 

Credit
      risk for the utility companies is spread over a diversified base of residential,
      commercial and industrial customers. Customers  payment records are continually
      monitored and credit deposits are required, when appropriate.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
      the
      Shareholders of Peoples Energy Corporation:  

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
      capitalization statements of Peoples Energy Corporation and subsidiary companies
      (the Company) as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
      statements of operations, stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the
      three years in the period ended September 30, 2006. Our audits also included
      the
      financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These
      consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
      responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
      schedules based on our audits. 

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Peoples Energy Corporation
      and subsidiary companies at September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of
      their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
      ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
      statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
      financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects
      the information set forth therein. 

As
      discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
      September 30, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for conditional
      asset retirement obligations to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 47,  Conditional
      Asset Retirement Obligations . 

We
      have
      also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal
      control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on the criteria
      established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework   
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
      our
      report dated December 14, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on management's
      assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
      reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
      internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
      The
      Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company: 

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
      capitalization statements of The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company and
      subsidiary companies (hereinafter referred to as Peoples Gas, a wholly owned
      subsidiary of Peoples Energy Corporation) as of September 30, 2006 and 2005,
      and
      the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholder s equity, and
      cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006.
      Our audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index
      at Item 15(a)2. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
      schedules are the responsibility of the management of Peoples Gas. Our
      responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
      statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits. 

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. Peoples Gas is not required to
      have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
      financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
      over
      financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
      appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
      opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
      of
      Peoples Gas. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
      examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
      in
      the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Peoples Gas at September
      30,
      2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
      of
      the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
      in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
      to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly
      in all material respects the information set forth therein. 

As
      discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
      September 30, 2006, Peoples Gas changed its method of accounting for conditional
      asset retirement obligations to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 47,  Conditional
      Asset Retirement Obligations .

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
      North
      Shore Gas Company: 

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
      capitalization statements of North Shore Gas Company and subsidiary companies
      (hereinafter referred to as North Shore Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of
      Peoples Energy Corporation) as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related
      consolidated statements of operations, stockholder s equity, and cash flows for
      each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006. Our audits
      also
      included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2.
      These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules are
      the responsibility of the management of North Shore Gas. Our responsibility
      is
      to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
      statement schedules based on our audits. 

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. North Shore Gas is not required
      to
      have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
      financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
      over
      financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
      appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
      opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
      of
      North Shore Gas. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
      examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
      in
      the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of North Shore Gas at September
      30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
      each
      of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
      in our opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in relation
      to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly
      in all material respects the information set forth therein. 

As
      discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
      September 30, 2006, North Shore Gas changed its method of accounting for
      conditional asset retirement obligations to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 47,
       Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations .

NOTES
      TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1:
      MERGER  

On  
      July 8,
      2006, WPS Resources Corporation (WPS Resources), Wedge Acquisition Corporation
      (Sub), a wholly owned subsidiary of WPS Resources, and Peoples Energy
      Corporation (the Company or Peoples Energy) entered into an Agreement and Plan
      of Merger (the Agreement). 

The
      Agreement provides for the merger of Sub with and into Peoples Energy (the
      Merger) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement,
      with Peoples Energy continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of
      the
      Merger, Peoples Energy will become a wholly owned subsidiary of WPS Resources,
      and Peoples Energy shareholders will receive shares of WPS Resources common
      stock in exchange for their shares of common stock of Peoples Energy. At the
      effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Peoples Energy
      issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled
      and converted into the right to receive 0.825 shares of common stock of WPS
      Resources. The companies expect that upon consummation of the Merger Peoples
      Energy shareholders will own approximately 42.4% of the common stock of WPS
      Resources and WPS Resources shareholders will own approximately 57.6% of the
      common stock of WPS Resources.  

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy have each made customary representations,
      warranties and covenants in the Agreement, including, among others, covenants
      to
      conduct their businesses in the ordinary course between the execution of the
      Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and covenants not to engage in
      certain kinds of transactions during that period. During such period, Peoples
      Energy will not declare cash dividends in excess of $0.545 per share per quarter
      without the prior consent of WPS Resources. Immediately after the effective
      time
      of the Merger, WPS Resources will adopt a dividend policy providing for a
      quarterly dividend of $0.66 per share of WPS Resources common stock, subject
      to
      evaluation over time as future business needs dictate. WPS Resources and Peoples
      Energy have made certain additional customary covenants, including, among
      others, covenants, subject to certain exceptions, (A) to cause a shareholders
      meeting to be held to consider approval of the Merger and the other transactions
      contemplated by the Agreement, (B) not to solicit proposals relating to
      alternative business combination transactions, and (C) not to enter into
      discussions concerning, or provide confidential information in connection with,
      alternative business combination transactions. 

Consummation
      of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including, among others,
      (i)
      approval of the shareholders of each of WPS Resources and Peoples Energy, (ii)
      absence of any material adverse effect, (iii) expiration or termination of
      the
      applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period, (iv) absence of any order
      or
      injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (v) the registration
      statement on Form S-4 shall have become effective, (vi) the shares of WPS
      Resources common stock issuable to Peoples Energy s shareholders pursuant to the
      Agreement and under the employee benefit plans of Peoples Energy shall have
      been
      approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, (vii) subject to certain
      exceptions, the accuracy of representations and warranties with respect to
      WPS
      Resources  and Peoples Energy s business, as applicable, (vii) receipt of
      customary tax opinions and (viii) receipt of all required statutory approvals
      from, among others, the FERC, the Federal Communications Commission, and state
      public service and utility commissions.  

The
      Agreement contains certain termination rights for both WPS Resources and Peoples
      Energy, and further provides that, upon termination of the Agreement under
      specified circumstances, a party would be required to pay the other party a
      termination fee of $45 million. In addition, under specified circumstances
      each
      party may be obligated to reimburse the other party for up to $15 million of
      expenses, which would reduce the amount of any required termination fee payable
      by that party. 

The
      consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing
      conditions applicable to both WPS   Resources
      and Peoples Energy, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals
      and
      the approval of the transaction by the shareholders of both WPS Resources and
      Peoples Energy. On August 2, 2006, WPS Resources, Peoples Energy, Peoples Gas
      and North Shore Gas jointly filed an application for approval of the Merger
      with
      the Commission. The companies seek the expedited consideration of the
      application by the  

-
          78
          - 

Commission,
      with requested approval by December 28, 2006 so that the Merger could close
      on
      or shortly after January 1, 2007. The application indicates that The Peoples
      Gas
      Light and Coke Company (Peoples Gas) and North Shore Gas Company (North Shore
      Gas) will further postpone filing rate cases until early 2007, with new rates
      to
      take effect in 2008 due to the normal 11-month rate case process in Illinois.
      On
      October 31, 2006, Commission Staff and Interveners filed Direct Testimony and
      opinion on the Merger proposal. On November 13, 2006, the Companies filed
      rebuttal testimony. 

WPS
      Resources and Peoples Energy filed their joint application for FERC approval
      on
      August 15, 2006. The comment period on the FERC filing passed with no comments
      received. On November 2, 2006, the FERC issued a deficiency letter identifying
      an item about which additional information was required, and WPS Resources
      and
      Peoples Energy responded on November 6, 2006. The comment period for this
      response was concluded on November 13, 2006. No comments were
      received. 

On
      August
      15, 2006, WPS Resources filed with PSCW for approval of amendments to its
 affiliated interest  agreements so that they include and apply to Peoples
      Energy and its subsidiaries, as appropriate, upon closing of the merger. These
      agreements govern the provision by and among WPS Resources and its regulated
      and
      non-regulated subsidiaries of services, property, and other things of value.
      Modification of these agreements requires the approval of the PSCW. WPS
      Resources had concluded that no other PSCW approvals were required prior to
      the
      closing of the merger. However, on August 9, 2006, the PSCW issued a notice
      of
      investigation of the merger to consider, among other things, whether the PSCW
      has jurisdiction and pre-approval authority over the merger. Subsequently,
      the
      PSCW asserted jurisdiction and pre-approval authority over the merger, and,
      on
      September 27, 2006, the PSCW re-noticed the investigatory matter as a contested
      case proceeding in which it would consider whether the merger is in the public
      interest and whether certain conditions should be placed upon WPS Resources
      (and
      affiliate arrangements within its holding company system) as a result of the
      merger. WPS Resources acknowledges the PSCW s continuing jurisdiction from time
      to time to consider and, if appropriate, impose additional conditions upon
      Wisconsin public utility holding companies. However, WPS Resources does not
      believe that the PSCW has jurisdiction and pre-approval authority over the
      merger, even though the PSCW has asserted such jurisdiction and authority.
      The
      PSCW has established a schedule for completion of the proceeding that would
      accommodate a closing of the merger in the first quarter of 2007. WPS Resources 
participation in the proceeding will be subject to its right to challenge the
      PSCW s asserted jurisdiction before the PSCW and on appeal of an adverse PSCW
      order. 

Pursuant
      to the Agreement, management from both companies jointly selected Integrys
      Energy Group, Inc. (Integrys) as the new name for the combined company. Upon
      consummation of the Merger, WPS Resources  Board of Directors will be comprised
      of sixteen directors, nine of whom will have been designated by WPS Resources
      and seven of whom will have been designated by Peoples Energy. Mr. Larry Weyers,
      currently Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of WPS Resources,
      will
      remain President and Chief Executive Officer of Integrys following the Merger.
      Mr. James Boris, currently the Lead Director of Peoples Energy will become
      the
      non-executive Chairman of Integrys as of the effective time of the Merger.
      Upon
      the consummation of the Merger, WPS Resources will amend bylaws consistent
      with
      the foregoing. 

On
      October 9, 2006, the Company identified many of Integrys  senior leaders, who
      will manage Integrys after the transaction closes through a holding company,
      operating companies and a services group. Following the Merger, Integrys will
      establish its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. The headquarters of the
      Integrys  unregulated energy marketing business will be located in Green Bay,
      Wisconsin and the headquarters of the utilities  businesses will be located in
      the same place as immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. The
      headquarters of the oil and gas production business will remain in Houston,
      Texas.  

On
      October 18, 2006, the WPS Resources registration statement on Form S-4 was
      made
      effective by the SEC.   On
      October 25, 2006, the Federal Trade Commission granted termination of the
      waiting period for the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing for the Merger. 

On
      December 6, 2006, at special meetings of shareholders held by WPS Resources
      and
      Peoples Energy, shareholders of both companies approved the proposed merger
      transaction. WPS Resources  shareholders also  

-
          79
          - 

approved
      an amendment to WPS Resources Corporation s restated articles of incorporation
      to change the name of WPS Resources Corporation to Integrys Energy Group, Inc.,
      when the closing of the merger has been completed. 

For
      the
      fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Company incurred merger related costs
      of $8.9 million, primarily legal, consulting and investment banking fees. Under
      SFAS No. 141, such costs are expensed as incurred by the Company as the acquired
      entity in the merger. The Company has recorded the income tax impact of merger
      costs based upon its current estimate of their ultimate treatment, however,
      this
      estimate is subject to change based upon the outcome of future
      events. 

2:
      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

A.
      General   

      Peoples
      Energy is a holding company whose income is derived principally from its
      regulated utility subsidiaries, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The utilities
      are primarily engaged in the sale and transportation of natural gas to
      residential, commercial and industrial customers in Chicago and the northeast
      section of Illinois. Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas  utility operations are
      subject to regulation by the Commission. Regulated operations are accounted
      for
      in accordance with SFAS No. 71. This standard controls the application of GAAP
      for companies whose rates are determined by an independent regulator such as
      the
      Commission. Under this standard, certain costs or revenues are deferred on
      the
      balance sheet until recovered or refunded through rates. Other business segments
      of the Company include Oil and Gas Production, Energy Marketing (both retail
      and
      wholesale activity), Energy Assets (primarily power generation), and Corporate
      and Other. 

The
      Company makes certain estimates and assumptions in preparing its consolidated
      financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of
      contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
      the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Actual
      results may differ from those estimates. 

All
      subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All
      significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
      Investments for which the Company or its subsidiaries have at least a 20%
      interest, but less than a majority ownership, are accounted for under the equity
      method, as the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but
      not control, over the investee s operating and financial policies.  

B.
      Discontinued Operations   

The
      Company announced in February, 2006 its intention to exit the power generation
      business. On January 31, 2006, the Company sold its 100% interest in the
      Valencia Energy power development site in New Mexico. On May 31, 2006, the
      Company completed the sale of its 27% interest in the SCEP facility to Exelon
      Generation Company, LLC. On September 20, 2006, the Company announced that
      it
      signed an agreement with J-Power USA Development Co., Ltd. to sell its 50%
      interest in the Elwood power generation facility and its 100% interest in a
      fully-permitted power development site, the COB Energy Facility (COB), for
      $110
      million, subject to certain closing adjustments. These sales will complete
      the
      divestiture of substantially all power assets owned by Peoples Energy. The
      Board
      of Directors of J-Power's parent company approved the transactions on November
      30, 2006. Financial results for power generation are now being reported by
      Peoples Energy as discontinued operations. Through Elwood and COB, the Company
      owned approximately 700 net Megawatts of power generation assets. 

The
      operating results of the Company s power generation business were reported under
      the Power Generation segment and included in consolidated operating income
      prior
      to the change in segment reporting described below and the treatment as
      discontinued operations. Effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the
      Company reports the results of operations of its power generation business
      as
      discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144. Results of operations
      and assets for all periods have been reclassified to conform with the
      discontinued operations presentation.

C.
      Gas Charge Settlement   

On
      March
      28, 2006, the Commission approved orders that settle gas charge reconciliation
      proceedings for fiscal years 2001 through 2004 for Peoples Energy Corporation
      and its utility subsidiaries. The orders, which became publicly available March
      30, adopt a January 17, 2006 Settlement Agreement and Release, as amended by
      an
      Amendment and Addendum dated March 6, 2006 (the Agreement).  

Pursuant
      to the Agreement, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas agreed to refund (through
      a
      credit applied to customer bills) the total sum of $100 million to their
      customers. In its orders approving the Agreement, the Commission determined
      that
      $96 million   should
      be
      refunded to customers of Peoples Gas and $4 million should be refunded to
      customers of North Shore Gas. In April 2006, the refund was credited to customer
      accounts. 

Pursuant
      to the Agreement, Peoples Energy also paid $5 million jointly to the City of
      Chicago and the Illinois Attorney General in 2006. The Company also agreed
      to
      pay up to $5 million per year over the next five years towards the funding
      of
      conservation and weatherization programs for low and moderate-income residential
      dwellings (Conservation Programs). The five subsequent payments of up to $5
      million shall be paid based upon Conservation Programs to be developed by the
      City of Chicago and/or the Illinois Attorney General. Peoples Gas and North
      Shore Gas will not seek recovery in any future rate or reconciliation cases
      of
      any amounts associated with the Conservation Programs. 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas agreed to forgive all outstanding bad debt from fiscal
      years 2000-2005 existing as of March 6, 2006, estimated at $207 million, remove
      the bad debt from customers  records and to not use any forgiven indebtedness as
      a reason to deny gas service. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas had written off
      the estimated $207 million in prior periods.  

-
          81
          - 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas agreed to credit fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 revenues
      derived from the provision of gas Hub services as an offset to utility
      customers  gas charges and to account for such revenues received from gas Hub
      services in the same manner in all future gas charge reconciliation cases.

The
      Company has reported for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 a charge
      reflecting the terms of the settlement. This charge totaled $107.3 million
      pretax or $1.68 per share after tax. The charge reflects $100 million in refunds
      to customers, $10.7 million to reflect a change in the regulatory accounting
      treatment for fiscal 2005 Hub revenues, $5 million in estimated additional
      bad
      debt expense   due
      to
      termination of collection activity on amounts previously written off and $5
      million related to the first payment to the Illinois Attorney General and City
      of Chicago under the settlement, and is net of approximately $13.3 million
      in
      previously recorded liabilities related to the cases. The $107.3 million charge
      has been allocated $103.0 million to Peoples Gas and $4.3 million to North
      Shore Gas in accordance with the Order. Accrued liabilities totaling $11.3
      million at September 30, 2006 are included in the consolidated balance sheet
      caption regulatory liabilities under current liabilities. Following is a
      reconciliation of the total gas charge settlement per the statement of
      operations and the related liability.

                    customers
                    pending close of  the
                    Commission's review of 2005 gas charge reconciliation and minor
                    amounts to
                    be refunded to customers  through
                    the monthly gas charge filings in early fiscal
                    2007.

        Note
        8A for a complete discussion of the gas charge cases and the settlement
        agreement. 

D.
      Use of Fair Value Measurements   

The
      Company reports certain contracts and instruments at fair value in accordance
      with GAAP. Fair value is based on actively quoted market prices, if available.
      In the absence of actively quoted market prices, the Company seeks indicative
      price information from external sources, including broker quotes and industry
      publications. If pricing information from external sources is not available,
      the
      Company must estimate prices based on available historical and near-term future
      price information and certain statistical methods, including regression
      analysis. 

-
          82
          - 

For
      options and contracts with option-like characteristics where pricing information
      is not available from external sources, the Company uses a modified
      Black-Scholes model and considers time value, the volatility of the underlying
      commodities and other relevant assumptions when estimating fair value. If
      pricing information is not available from external sources, judgment is required
      to develop the estimates of fair value. For individual contracts, the use of
      different assumptions could have a material effect on the contract s estimated
      fair value. 

The
      following table summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of long-term
      debt financial instruments included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the
      Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. 

The
      estimated fair values are determined based on the long-term debt interest rates
      that are currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms, call
      dates
      and remaining maturities. The carrying amount of all other financial instruments
      approximate fair value. 

Considerable
      judgment is required to develop the fair value estimates; therefore, the values
      are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a
      current market exchange. The fair value estimates are based on information
      available to management as of each fiscal year-end. Management is not aware
      of
      any subsequent factors that would affect significantly the estimated fair value
      amounts. 

E.
      Revenue Recognition   

      Natural
      gas and electricity sales and transportation revenues for the utilities and
      Peoples Energy Services Corporation are recorded on the accrual basis for all
      gas and electricity delivered during the month, including an estimate for gas
      and electricity delivered but unbilled at the end of each month. The amount
      of
      accrued unbilled revenue included in gross receivables from customers is
      summarized below. 

In
      Illinois, delivering, supplying, furnishing or selling gas for use or
      consumption and not for resale is subject to state and, in some cases, municipal
      taxes (revenue taxes). The Illinois Public Utilities Act provides that the
      tax
      may be recovered from utility customers by adding an additional charge to
      customers' bills. These taxes are due only to the extent they are collected
      as
      cash receipts as opposed to amounts billed. As a result, most revenue taxes
      are
      reported on a gross basis, whereby the billed amounts for the recovery of these
      taxes are included in revenues and an offsetting expense amount (net of an
      administrative fee) representing the expected cash payment of the taxes is
      included in taxes, other than income taxes on the statement of operations.
      Revenue tax amounts included in utility revenues are as follows: 

In
      the
      Oil and Gas production segment, natural gas and crude oil production revenues
      are recorded on the entitlement method. Under the entitlement method, revenue
      is
      recorded when title is transferred based on the  

-
          83
          - 

Company's
      net interest. The Company records its entitled share of revenues based on
      estimated monthly production volumes. Subsequently, these estimated volumes
      are
      adjusted to reflect actual volumes that are supported by third party statements
      and/or cash receipts. 

F.
      Weather Insurance   

      The
      Company was partially protected from the impact of unusually mild weather by
      a
      weather insurance program subject to certain deductibles and maximums for fiscal
      year 2005. The contract settled annually at the fiscal year-end. The insurance
      proceeds are reported as revenue and the premium is charged to operating expense
      based on the guidance of EITF 99-02. The Company recorded $3.5 million in
      weather insurance recovery as revenue in 2005 and no revenue was recorded in
      2006 or 2004. 

G.
      Income Taxes   

      The
      Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income
      taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes have been recorded using
      currently enacted tax rates for the differences between the tax basis of assets
      and liabilities and the basis reported in the financial statements. Due to
      the
      effects of regulation on Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, certain adjustments
      made to deferred income taxes are, in turn, recorded as regulatory assets
      (liabilities). (See Note 2K.) 

Income
      taxes allocated to Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas are included in the
      consolidated tax return of the Company. The separate return method has not
      been
      used, but the principles of that method are generally followed. Deferred taxes
      exist at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas only if the temporary differences
      that
      generate those deferred taxes are derived from assets and liabilities of Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas. Additionally, the taxable income of Peoples Gas and
      North Shore Gas is the basis for recording current income tax expense and cash
      payments by each utility. Finally, tax benefits of loss companies, or tax
      credits from nonutility subsidiaries of the Company, are allocated to those
      nonutility subsidiaries. 

There
      are
      specific deviations from the separate return method. North Shore Gas could
      be an
      alternative minimum tax (AMT) taxpayer if it were a stand-alone company but
      only
      records a deferred tax asset and pays amounts to the Company if the entire
      group
      is an AMT taxpayer. North Shore Gas uses the federal income tax marginal rate
      of
      35%, but on a stand-alone basis, it would use a marginal rate between 34% and
      35%. Finally, if Peoples Gas or North Shore Gas were to have a capital loss,
      and
      another member of the group had capital gains to offset that loss, no deferred
      tax asset or increase to income tax expense would result. 

Each
      utility subsidiary within the consolidated group nets its income tax-related
      regulatory assets and liabilities. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, net
      regulatory income tax assets for both the Company and Peoples Gas amounted
      to
      $22.6 million and $23.1 million, respectively. At September 30, 2006 and 2005,
      net regulatory income tax liabilities for both the Company and North Shore
      Gas
      recorded in other liabilities equaled $2.1 million and $2.0 million,
      respectively. 

Investment
      tax credits have been deferred and are being amortized to income over the
      remaining book lives of related property. 

H.
      Asset Retirement Obligations   

SFAS
      No. 143  

      Legal
      retirement obligations previously identified at the Company under the provisions
      of SFAS No. 143, related primarily to reserve assets at the Oil and Gas
      Production segment. Those obligations totaled $2.0 million and $1.6 million
      at
      September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

Adoption
      of FIN 47  

      The
      Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47, as of September 30, 2006. Upon
      adoption of this interpretation, the Company recorded liabilities for
      conditional asset retirement obligations, which were previously believed to
      be
      outside the scope of SFAS No. 143. 

-
          84
          - 

As
      of
      September 30, 2006, the Company recorded as conditional asset retirement
      obligations the following amounts: 

Pipe
                Removal - Distribution (including asbestos and PCBs in pipes) - $109.0
                million 

Asbestos
                and PCBs in Property - $0.5 million 

Above
                Ground Storage Tanks - $0.8 million 

The
      Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas also recorded an increase in the net
      carrying value of related property, plant and equipment and an increase in
      regulatory assets for future retirement costs as part of adopting FIN 47:

The
      cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 has been deferred as a regulatory asset
      in
      anticipation that the actual costs to dispose of the assets will be recoverable
      in future rates. Under SFAS No. 71, regulatory assets are recognized for timing
      differences between the Company s recovery of the asset retirement obligations
      in rates and when the Company recognizes these costs under FIN 47. 

If
      the
      Company had applied the provisions of FIN 47 as of October 1, 2003, the pro
      forma impacts on net income and basic and diluted earnings per common share
      would not be material. The following table lists the pro forma amount of the
      liability for asset retirement obligations for prior years.  

Changes
      to Asset Retirement Obligation Liabilities  

      The
      following table describes all changes to the asset retirement obligations of
      the
      Company through September 30, 2006, including the adoption of FIN
      47.    

-
          85
          - 

I.
      Property, Plant and Equipment   

      Property,
      plant and equipment is stated at original cost and includes amounts for
      capitalized labor costs, payroll taxes, employee benefit costs, administrative
      costs and an allowance for funds used during construction or capitalized
      interest as appropriate. 

The
      Company s utility subsidiaries charge the cost of maintenance and repairs of
      property and minor renewals and improvements of property to maintenance expense.
      When depreciable property is retired, its original cost is charged to the
      accumulated provision for depreciation. The provision for depreciation
      substantially reflects the systematic amortization of the original cost of
      depreciable property, net of the accumulated reserve for depreciation, over
      the
      estimated composite remaining useful lives on the straight-line method.
      Additionally, actual dismantling cost, net of salvage, is recorded as
      depreciation expense in the month incurred. In April 2005, the Commission
      approved new depreciation rates for both Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas that
      reflect longer useful lives on utility plant. The $6.6 million impact ($5.4
      million for Peoples Gas and $1.2 million for North Shore Gas) of the
      depreciation change was retroactive to October 1, 2004, the effective date
      of
      the Commission Depreciation Order. 

Diversified
      businesses  depreciable properties, other than oil and gas producing properties,
      are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized
      at the time of asset sale or disposition. 

The
      consolidated provision for depreciation and amortization for the Company,
      expressed as an annual percentage of the original cost of depreciable property,
      was 2.7%, 2.7% and 3.0% for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
      For
      Peoples Gas the annual percentage was 2.7%, 2.7% and 3.0% for fiscal years
      2006,
      2005 and 2004, respectively. For North Shore Gas the annual percentage was
      1.8%,
      1.8% and 2.3% for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

In
      the
      case of oil and gas producing properties, the Company is amortizing associated
      capitalized costs by utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting
      on
      the units-of-production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves.
      The fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 average rate of depletion was   $2.11,
      $1.87 and $1.69 per Mcfe unit of production, respectively. 

At
      September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have any exploratory
      pre-production wells requiring additional major capital expenditures (to
      determine presence of proved reserves) or any exploratory wells where more
      than
      one year had elapsed since the completion of drilling without a determination
      of
      well results. 

At
      September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had no capitalized exploratory well
      costs pending determination of proved reserves. A portion of exploration expense
      recognized in fiscal 2004 relates to the expensing of $2.7 million in costs
      previously capitalized. 

The
      Company performs an evaluation for impairment whenever events or changes in
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets or
      intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable. These assets are
      written down to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash
      flows is less than the carrying amounts. Fiscal 2006 results from discontinued
      operations include impairments of $2.1 million. There were no impairments
      recorded in 2005. Impairments recorded in 2004 were $1.1 million in the Energy
      Marketing segment. 

J.
      Gas in Storage   

      The
      Company s utility subsidiaries price storage injections except for liquid
      propane at North Shore Gas at the fiscal-year average of the costs of natural
      gas supply purchased. Withdrawals from storage for the utilities except for
      liquid propane at North Shore Gas are priced on the LIFO cost method. The
      estimated replacement cost of gas in inventory at September 30, 2006 and 2005
      exceeded the LIFO cost by approximately $83.7 million and $583.3 million,
      respectively. North Shore Gas accounts for liquid propane inventory using the
      average cost method. 

The
      estimated replacement cost of gas in inventory for Peoples Gas at September
      30,
      2006 and 2005 exceeded the LIFO cost by approximately $70.9 million and $498.4
      million, respectively. The estimated replacement cost of  

-
          86
          - 

gas
      in
      inventory exclusive of the liquid propane for North Shore Gas at September
      30,
      2006 and 2005 exceeded the LIFO cost by approximately $12.7 million and $84.9
      million, respectively. Both Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas  calculation used a
      year-end Chicago city-gate gas price per Dth of $3.67 for fiscal 2006 and $11.70
      for fiscal 2005. 

The
      Energy Marketing and Energy Assets segments account for gas in inventory using
      the average cost method. A portion of gas in storage for Energy Marketing is
      reported at fair value to reflect the effects of fair value hedge accounting
      in
      accordance with SFAS No. 133. 

K.
      Regulated Operations   

      Peoples
      Gas  and North Shore Gas  utility operations are subject to regulation by the
      Commission. Regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with SFAS
      No.
      71. This standard controls the application of GAAP for companies whose rates
      are
      determined by an independent regulator such as the Commission.   Regulatory
      assets represent probable future revenue associated with certain incurred costs
      that will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory
      liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to
      customers. 

The
      table
      below summarizes the regulatory assets and liabilities of Peoples Gas and North
      Shore Gas that were reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

Environmental
      costs, net of recoveries are the deferred costs associated with former
      manufactured gas plant operations, which are allowed to be recovered by the
      utilities from customers on a dollar-for-dollar basis. For each utility
      subsidiary, the Commission conducts annual proceedings regarding the
      reconciliation of revenues and related environmental costs. If the Commission
      were to find that the reconciliation was inaccurate or any of the environmental
      costs were imprudently incurred, the Commission would order the utility to
      refund the affected amount to customers.  

Under
      the
      tariffs of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, all prudently incurred gas costs
      are
      recoverable from customers. The difference for any month between costs
      recoverable through the Gas Charge and the actual amount billed to customers
      under the Gas Charge is recovered from or refunded to customers through future
      adjustments to the Gas Charge. Such difference for any month is recorded either
      as a current asset or as a current  

-
          87
          - 

liability
      (with a contra entry to gas costs). Gas costs consist of two types Commodity and
      Non-Commodity costs. The two types are tracked independently and may cause
      both
      an accounts receivable from and an accounts payable to customers. 

Gas
      costs
      recoverable and refundable through rate adjustments represent the regulatory
      assets and liabilities, respectively, that result from the annual proceedings
      conducted by the Commission regarding the reconciliation of revenues from the
      Gas Charge and related gas costs. If the Commission were to find that the
      reconciliation was inaccurate or any gas costs were imprudently incurred, the
      Commission would order the utility to refund the affected amount to customers
      through subsequent Gas Charge filings (see Note 8A). 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas use derivative instruments to manage each utility s
      respective cost of gas supply. SFAS No. 71 allows for MTM derivative gains
      and
      losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Realized
      gains and losses are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of gas supply in
      the
      period that the underlying gas purchase transaction takes place. The costs
      and
      benefits of this activity are passed through to customers under the tariffs
      of
      Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. 

Costs
      related to utility asset retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143 and FIN
      47
      are recoverable from utility customers. The Commission previously has approved
      Company recovery of significant retirement (decommissioning) costs through
      the
      establishment of a regulatory asset. Amounts charged to customers for the costs
      related to the retirement of long-lived assets may differ from the period costs
      recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 143 and FIN 47 and, therefore, may result
      in a difference in the timing of recognition of period costs for financial
      reporting and rate-making purposes. Under the requirements of SFAS No. 71,
      the
      Company s utility subsidiaries have recognized a regulatory asset for this
      difference. 

Certain
      regulatory assets do not result from cash expenditures, and therefore do not
      represent investments included in rate base or have offsetting liabilities
      that
      reduce the rate base of the utilities. Incremental environmental costs incurred
      and not yet recovered from customers and recoverable gas costs, which are
      generally recovered within one year, are not included in rate base. However,
      the
      Company is allowed to recover a carrying cost for amounts spent but not yet
      collected from customers. The regulatory assets related to debt are not included
      in rate base, but are recovered over the term of the debt through the rate
      of
      return authorized by the Commission. 

L.
      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities   

      The
      Company's earnings may vary due to changes in commodity prices and interest
      rates (market risk) that affect its operations and investments. To manage this
      risk, the Company uses forward contracts and financial instruments, including
      commodity futures contracts, swaps and options. It is the policy of the Company
      to use these instruments solely for the purpose of managing risk and not for
      any
      speculative purpose. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments
      pursuant to SFAS No. 133. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 133, all derivatives
      are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value unless they qualify
      for
      the normal purchases and normal sales exception. 

Cash
      Flow Hedges.    The
      Company has positions in oil and gas reserves, natural gas, and transportation
      as part of its Oil and Gas Production and Energy Marketing businesses, and
      related to its company use gas in the Gas Distribution segment. The Company
      uses
      derivative financial instruments to protect against loss of value of future
      anticipated cash transactions caused by commodity price changes in the
      marketplace. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges, which allow
      for the effective portion of unrealized changes in value during the life of
      the
      hedge to be recorded in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses
      from commodity cash flow hedges are recorded in revenues or cost of energy
      sold
      in the statement of operations in the same month the related physical sales
      or
      purchases are recorded in the statement of operations. 

Cash
      flow
      hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer probable that the original
      forecasted transactions will occur. The carrying value of contracts which no
      longer qualify for hedge accounting are prospectively marked-to-market, with
      the
      change in value recorded in each reporting period in the statement of
      operations. If the original forecasted transactions are probable of not
      occurring, any amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income are
      immediately recorded in the statement of operations. In fiscal 2005, the Company
      recognized a pretax loss of $0.3 million against revenues in the statement
      of
      operations related to the  

-
          88
          - 

discontinuance
      of oil cash flow hedges for which the forecasted transactions are probable
      of
      not occurring. In addition, cash flow hedge ineffectiveness can result from
      differences in critical terms (such as location) between the hedging instrument
      and the hedged transaction and result in the immediate recognition of gains
      or
      losses recorded in revenues. Hedge ineffectiveness pretax gains totaled $7.4
      million in fiscal 2006 and were due primarily to the reversal of MTM
      ineffectiveness recorded in previous years in the Oil and Gas Production
      segment. Any actual ineffectiveness realized is reflected in revenue as an
      offset to this gain. Hedge ineffectiveness pretax losses totaled $8.2 million
      in
      fiscal 2005 and were due primarily to unusually wide differentials between
      NYMEX
      prices and field prices in the Oil and Gas Production segment subsequent to
      hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  

The
      following table summarizes selected information related to cash flow hedges
      included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Balance Sheet through
      September 30, 2006. 

Mark-to-Market
      Derivative Instruments.    Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas use derivative instruments to manage each utility's
      cost
      of gas supply and mitigate price volatility. All such derivative instruments
      are
      measured at fair value. The regulated utilities' tariffs allow for full recovery
      from their customers of prudently incurred gas supply costs, including gains
      or
      losses on these derivative instruments. As a result, SFAS No. 71 allows for
      these MTM derivative gains or losses to be recorded as regulatory assets or
      regulatory liabilities. Realized gains or losses are recorded as an adjustment
      to the cost of gas supply in the period that the underlying gas purchase
      transaction takes place. The costs and benefits of this activity are passed
      through to customers under the tariffs of Peoples Gas and North Shore
      Gas. 

Fair
      Value Hedges.   
      The
      Company uses financial hedges to protect the value of a portion of Energy
      Marketing s gas in storage and these are accounted for as fair value hedges. The
      change in value of these hedges, along with the offsetting change in value
      of
      the inventory hedged (to the extent the hedge is effective), are recorded on
      the
      statement of operations in each reporting period's cost of energy sold.

The
      Energy Marketing segment recorded in fiscal 2006 and 2005 $3.2 million and
      $3.3
      million in MTM losses, respectively, related to the application of fair value
      hedge accounting to certain retail storage inventory  

-
          89
          - 

transactions.
      The segment uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk and substantially
      lock in the profit margin that it will ultimately realize when inventory volumes
      are withdrawn from storage. Under fair value accounting, which this segment
      is
      using for certain storage activity, the MTM adjustment to inventory is computed
      using spot prices, while the derivatives used to mitigate the risk of changes
      in
      inventory value are marked to market using forward prices. When the spot price
      of natural gas changes disproportionately to the forward price, the difference
      is recorded in operating results. As a result, earnings are subject to
      volatility, even when the underlying expected profit margin over the duration
      of
      the contracts is unchanged. The volatility resulting from this accounting can
      be
      significant from period to period. This accounting loss will reverse next year
      as the volumes are withdrawn from storage. 

The
      Company also uses certain financial instruments to adjust the portfolio
      composition of its debt from fixed-rate to floating-rate debt. These derivative
      instruments are accounted for as fair value hedges. The change in value of
      these
      hedges along with the offsetting change in value of the debt hedged (to the
      extent the hedge is effective) are recorded in each reporting period in interest
      expense in the statement of operations. 

M.
      Related Party Transactions   

      Peoples
      Energy Corporation provides administrative services for its subsidiaries. These
      services include purchasing, accounting, finance and treasury, tax, information
      technology, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources
      and
      other miscellaneous services. Costs for these services amounted to $83.1
      million, $69.0 million and $79.3 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. Specific and systematic cost allocation methodologies are used
      to
      allocate the costs and include such factors as payroll, number of employees,
      space occupied and capital investment. 

Peoples
      Gas also provides certain billing, cash receipts processing, customer care,
      gas
      transportation and other services to North Shore Gas and bills for services
      rendered. Peoples Gas billings to North Shore Gas were $6.6 million; $6.1
      million and $6.7 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
      respectively. 

Intercompany
      receivables and payables at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas at September 30,
      2005 and 2004 primarily represent MTM gains on derivative instruments (see
      Note
      2L) executed by the Company on behalf of its utility subsidiaries. Intercompany
      payables at Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas also relate to administrative
      service provided by the Company.  

For
      the
      fiscal years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004, Peoples Energy Resources sold natural
      gas to Elwood for use at the Elwood power generation facility in the amounts
      of
      $20.4 million, $44.1 million and $13.7 million, respectively. Peoples Energy
      Resources had $0.8 million and $9.4 million in accounts receivable from Elwood
      at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These sales will cease in fiscal
      2007 after the sale of Elwood (see Note 2B), however, the impact on income
      from
      continuing operations will not be material to the Company's consolidated
      financial statements. At September 30, 2006, the Company had a 50% equity
      interest in Elwood. (See Note 5.) 

N.
      Statement of Cash Flows   

      For
      purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid
      financial instruments with a maturity at the date of purchase of three months
      or
      less to be cash equivalents. Under the Company s cash management practices,
      checks issued pending clearance that result in overdraft balances for accounting
      purposes are included in accounts payable and total $14.0 million and $9.1
      million as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For Peoples Gas, the
      overdraft amounts in accounts payable at September 30, 2006 and 2005 were $8.0
      million and $7.1 million, respectively. North Shore Gas  overdraft amount in
      accounts payable at September 30, 2006 and 2005, was zero and $0.4 million,
      respectively. 

Noncash
      investing and financing activities in fiscal 2006 include the Company s
      recognition of conditional asset retirement obligations under FIN 47 and related
      additional investments in property plant and equipment and regulatory assets.
      (See Note 2H for a discussion of the impact of adoption of FIN 47 on the
      Company, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.)

O.
            Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements    

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, which prescribes a recognition threshold and
      measurement approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement
      of
      a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally,
      FIN
      48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim
      periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The provisions
      of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006,
      with
      the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an
      adjustment to opening retained earnings. The Company is still evaluating whether
      the requirements of FIN 48 will have a significant effect on its financial
      condition or results of operations. 

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements.  SFAS
      No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
      in
      generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair
      value measurements. The provisions of this standard apply to other accounting
      pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement
      is
      effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
      November 15, 2007 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
      is still evaluating whether the requirements of SFAS No. 157 will have a
      significant effect on its financial condition or results of
      operations. 

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which requires an employer to
      recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
      postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability
      in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded
      status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income.
      This
      Statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan
      as of
      the date of its year-end statement of financial position, with limited
      exceptions. An employer with publicly traded equity securities is required
      to
      initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
      and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the fiscal year ending
      after December 15, 2006. The Company expects that the requirements of SFAS
      No.
      158 may have a significant effect on its balance sheet (with a combined
      reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income or increase in regulatory
      assets estimated to be about $150 million based on current market and employee
      data). The Company will also be required to move its measurement date from
      June
      30th to September 30th. As the actual impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 will
      be
      dependent upon the fair value of plan assets and the amount of projected benefit
      obligations measured as of September 30, 2007, the above estimated amount may
      not be reflective of the actual impact of the adoption. 

In
      September 2006, the SEC issued SAB No. 108, which provides interpretive guidance
      on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements
      should be considered in evaluating whether current year financial
      statements are materially misstated. The SEC staff believes that registrants
      should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement
      approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a
      misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
      considered, is material. SAB No. 108 is effective as of the end of fiscal years
      ending after November 15, 2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 is not expected
      to
      have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial
      statements. 

P.
      Contingencies, Indemnities and Commitments    

      Contingent
      obligations, including indemnities, litigation and other possible commitments
      are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, which requires that an
      estimated loss be recorded if it is probable that an asset has been impaired
      or
      a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the
      amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Accordingly, those contingencies
      that are deemed to be probable and where the amount of loss is reasonably
      estimable are accrued in the financial statements. If only a range of loss
      can
      be determined, the best estimate within that range is accrued; if none of the
      estimates within that range is better than another, the low end of the range
      is
      accrued. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a
      reasonable possibility that a loss has been or will be incurred, even if the
      amount is not estimable. The assessment of contingencies is a highly subjective
      process that requires judgments about future events. Contingencies are reviewed
      at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related
      financial statement disclosure. The ultimate settlement of contingencies may
      differ materially from amounts accrued in the financial
      statements.

Change
      in Segment Reporting   

      Beginning
      in fiscal 2006, the Company restructured the management and operations of
      certain of its businesses and has realigned its segment reporting to match
      these
      changes. The financial data by business segment presented below has been
      reclassified to conform with the new reportable segments. The Company's
      reportable segments are Gas Distribution (including Peoples Gas hub operations,
      formerly included as part of Midstream Services), Oil and Gas Production, Energy
      Assets, Energy Marketing (both retail and wholesale activity, formerly included
      as Retail Energy Services and part of Midstream Services, respectively), and

4:
      RESTRUCTURING CHARGE  

During
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company commenced a restructuring plan
      to
      enhance operating efficiency and customer service and to mitigate the impact
      of
      rising operating costs on utility customers, while maintaining solid financial
      results for the Company. The restructuring activities were designed to result
      in
      a reduction of over 100 nonunion permanent positions at all levels in the
      utility business and corporate support functions. An enhanced voluntary
      termination severance package was offered to nonunion employees including a
      termination allowance of three weeks' pay for each completed year of service
      up
      to a maximum of 52 weeks of pay, outplacement assistance, enhanced educational
      assistance, and reduced Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
      rates. Approximately 300 employees accepted the package, resulting in about
      200
      open positions, some of which have been filled in fiscal 2005 and
      2006. 

The
      restructuring activities were substantially completed by September 30, 2004.
      The
      restructuring plan resulted in aggregate costs of $17.0 million to the
      Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2004. Included in this amount
      were costs of $9.7 million and $0.9 million related to Peoples Gas and North
      Shore Gas, respectively, based primarily upon severance payments and related
      employer payroll taxes at each respective utility. The table below summarizes
      the total Company charge by major type of cost. 

A
      total
      of $16.6 million has been paid for severance payments, program expenses,
      employer taxes and legal fees. Substantially all payments were made during
      fiscal 2005, and no significant future payments are anticipated. In addition,
      approximately $0.4 million in severance costs originally accrued were reversed
      in connection with the revocation of severance agreements during fiscal
      2005. 

In
      fiscal
      2005, the Company recorded $13.1 million for pension settlements and
      curtailments, net of capitalized amounts, associated with the restructuring
      plan
      described above (see Note 11). Included in this amount were charges of $8.8
      million and $0.6 million for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, respectively.
      As
      the Company s pension plan measurement year ends June 30, these restructuring
      costs for settlements and curtailments subsequent to June 30, 2004 were required
      to be recognized in fiscal 2005.

      EQUITY
      INVESTMENTS  

The
      Company has several investments in the form of partnerships that are accounted
      for as unconsolidated equity method investments. Individually, the Company's
      equity investments do not meet the requirements for separate financial statement
      disclosure. However, in aggregate these investments are material. The Company
      records its share of equity investment income based on financial information
      it
      receives from the partnerships. All information is current or based on estimated
      results for the quarter. The Company is not a managing partner in any of these
      investments. 

On
      May
      31, 2006 the Company completed the sale of its interest in the SCEP facility
      and
      recognized a pretax gain of $4.1 million. On September 20, 2006, the Company
      announced that it signed an agreement with J-Power to sell its 50% interest
      in
      Elwood by December 2006. (See Note 2B.) 

In
      fiscal
      2006 Peoples Energy Production, through its equity investment in EnerVest
      Energy, L.P. (EnerVest), recognized a $7.8 million gain related to the sale
      of
      all remaining properties in the partnership.   The
      partnership is in the process of winding up its affairs. Peoples Energy
      Production has no remaining capital investment commitments with the EnerVest
      partnership. 

On
      September 30, 2005, Trigen-Peoples District Energy Company (Trigen-Peoples),
      a
      50%-50% partnership between the Company and Trigen Energy Company (Trigen),
      sold
      its district heating and cooling plant. The Company liquidated its partnership
      with Trigen effective with the sale of the plant.

      CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  

Peoples
      Gas provides natural gas service to approximately 815,000 customers within
      Chicago. North Shore Gas provides natural gas service to about 156,000 customers
      within approximately 275 square miles in northeastern Illinois. Credit risk
      for
      the utility companies is spread over a diversified base of residential,
      commercial and industrial customers. 

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas encourage customers to participate in their
      long-standing budget payment programs, which allow the cost of higher gas
      consumption levels associated with the heating season to be spread over a
      12-month billing cycle. Customers  payment records are continually monitored and
      credit deposits are required, when appropriate. 

Peoples
      Energy Services, one of the Company s Energy Marketing subsidiaries, sells
      natural gas to approximately 37,100 commercial, industrial and residential
      customers in northern Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and New York. It also sells
      electricity to approximately 3,400 commercial and industrial customers in
      Illinois. Customers  payment records are continually monitored and credit
      deposits are required, when appropriate. Peoples Energy Wholesale Marketing,
      also included in the Company s Energy Marketing segment, buys and sells natural
      gas through a variety of counterparties.  

The
      Company has ownership interests in one natural gas-fired power plant, Elwood
      at
      50%. Elwood s plant capacity and output has been sold on a long-term basis to
      two counterparties: Constellation and Exelon. This activity is included in
      the
      Energy Assets segment as discontinued operations. 

In
      August
      2006, S P and Moody s ratings on Elwood s bonds were upgraded to BB- and
      Ba1, respectively, with a stable outlook.

      ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  

A.
      Former Manufactured Gas Plant   

      The
      Company's utility subsidiaries, their predecessors and certain former affiliates
      operated facilities in the past at multiple sites for the purpose of
      manufacturing gas and storing manufactured gas. In connection with manufacturing
      and storing gas, waste materials were produced that may have resulted in soil
      and groundwater contamination at these sites. Under certain laws and regulations
      relating to the protection of the environment, the subsidiaries might be
      required to undertake remedial action with respect to some of these materials.
      The subsidiaries are addressing these sites under a program supervised by the
      Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. 

Peoples
      Gas is addressing 29 manufactured gas sites, including several sites described
      in more detail below. Investigations have been completed at all or portions
      of
      25 sites. Remediations have been completed at all or portions of nine of these
      25 sites. Peoples Gas has determined that remediations are not required at
      three
      of these 25 sites. 

North
      Shore Gas is addressing five manufactured gas sites, including one site
      described in more detail below. Investigations have been completed at all or
      portions of four sites. Remediations have not yet been completed at any of
      these
      four sites. North Shore Gas has determined that remediation is not required
      at
      one of these four sites. 

The
      United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified North Shore
      Gas as a potentially responsible party (PRP) under the Comprehensive
      Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
      (CERCLA), at the Waukegan Coke Plant Site located in Waukegan, Illinois
      (Waukegan Site). The Waukegan Site is part of the Outboard Marine Corporation
      (OMC) Superfund Site. The EPA also has identified OMC, General Motors
      Corporation and certain other parties as PRPs at the Waukegan Site. The EPA
      has
      issued a record of decision (ROD) selecting the remedial action for the Waukegan
      Site. The selected remedy consists of on-site treatment of groundwater and
      off-site disposal of soil containing polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and
      arsenic. North Shore Gas and the other PRPs have executed a remedial action
      consent decree which has been entered by the federal district court. The consent
      decree requires North Shore Gas and General Motors, jointly and severally,
      to
      perform the remedial action and establish and maintain financial assurance
      of
      $27 million. The soil component of the remedial action was completed in August
      2005. The groundwater component of the remedial action is undergoing design
      and
      is expected to begin in 2007. The EPA has agreed to reduce the financial
      assurance requirement to $21 million to reflect completion of the soil component
      of the remedial action  . 

In
      2004,
      the owners (River Village West) of a property in the vicinity of the former
      Pitney Court Station filed suit against Peoples Gas in the United States
      District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the Resource
      Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The suit,    River
      Village West LLC et al v. The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company   ,
      No.
      04-C-3392 (N.D. Ill. 2004), seeks an order directing Peoples Gas to remediate
      the site. In December 2005, Peoples Gas and the plaintiffs settled and the
      litigation has been dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to the terms of the
      settlement agreement, Peoples Gas has agreed to remediate the site and to
      investigate and, if necessary, remediate sediments in the area of the Chicago
      River adjacent to the site. 

With
      respect to portions of certain other sites in the City of Chicago (Chicago),
      Peoples Gas has received demands from site owners and others asserting standing
      regarding the investigation or remediation of their parcels. Some of these
      demands seek to require Peoples Gas to perform extensive investigations or
      remediations. These demands include notice letters sent to Peoples Gas by River
      Village West. These letters informed Peoples Gas of River Village West's intent
      to file suit under RCRA seeking an order directing Peoples Gas to remediate

-
          97
          - 

seven
      former manufactured gas plant sites located on or near the Chicago River. In
      April 2005, River Village West filed suit against Peoples Gas in the United
      States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under RCRA. The
      suit,    River
      Village West LLC et al v. The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company   ,
      No.
      05-C-2103 (N.D. Ill. 2005), seeks an order directing Peoples Gas to remediate
      three of the seven sites: the former South Station, the former Throop Street
      Station and the former Hough Place Station. Peoples Gas is currently engaged
      in
      settlement discussions with River Village West. 

In
      August
      2006, an individual filed suit against Peoples Gas in the United States District
      Court for the Northern District of Illinois under RCRA. The suit,    Thomas
      A. Snitzer v. The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company   ,
      No.
      06-C-4465 (N.D. Ill. 2006), seeks an order directing Peoples Gas to remediate
      the Willow Street Station former manufactured gas plant site which is located
      along the Chicago River. Peoples Gas has filed an answer and the court has
      set a
      scheduling order. In October 2006, the same individual filed another suit in
      the
      United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under RCRA
      and CERCLA. The suit,    Thomas
      A. Snitzer v. The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company   ,
      No.
      06-C-5901 (N.D. Ill. 2006), seeks an order directing Peoples Gas to remediate
      the following four former manufactured gas plant sites, which are located on
      or
      near the Chicago River: 22   nd   
      Street
      Station, Division Street Station, Hawthorne Station, and North Shore Avenue
      Station. This individual has also notified Peoples Gas of his intent to file
      suit under RCRA and CERCLA seeking an order directing Peoples Gas to remediate
      the following two former manufactured gas plant sites: Calumet Station and
      North
      Station.  

The
      utility subsidiaries are accruing liabilities and deferring costs (recorded
      as
      regulatory assets) incurred in connection with all of the manufactured gas
      sites, including related legal expenses, pending recovery through rates or
      from
      other entities. At September 30, 2006, regulatory assets (stated in current
      year dollars) were recorded in the following amounts: for Peoples Gas, $244
      million; for North Shore Gas, $69 million; and for the Company on a consolidated
      basis, $313 million. Each of the foregoing amounts reflects the net amount
      of
      (1) costs incurred to date, (2) carrying costs, (3) amounts recovered from
      insurance companies, other entities and customers, and (4) management's best
      estimates of the costs the utilities will spend in the future for investigating
      and remediating the manufactured gas sites. Management has recorded liabilities
      for the amounts described in clause (4) of the preceding sentence as follows:
      for Peoples Gas, $201 million; for North Shore Gas, $68 million; and for the
      Company on a consolidated basis, $269 million. Management also estimates that
      additional costs in excess of the recorded liabilities are reasonably possible
      in the following amounts: for Peoples Gas, $113 million; for North Shore Gas,
      $79 million; and for the Company on a consolidated basis, $192
      million. 

Management's
      foregoing estimates are developed with the aid of probabilistic modeling. They
      are based upon an ongoing review and judgment by management of potential costs
      associated with conducting investigative and remedial actions at the
      manufactured gas sites, and of the likelihood of incurring such costs. The
      liabilities recorded reflect the costs of all activities estimated, as a result
      of this analysis, to have a 75% or greater likelihood of occurrence. The
      additional costs described above as reasonably possible reflect the difference
      between the costs reflected in the liabilities for manufactured gas sites and
      costs that would result from the use of a lower probability threshold determined
      for each subsidiary by management after considering the sites included for
      that
      subsidiary. Because these estimates reflect future expenditures, they are
      sensitive to changes in assumptions with respect to the probability and
      magnitude of the various factors used in the modeling. The estimates are also
      affected by changes that result from the Company's actual experience in
      remediating the sites. 

Actual
      costs, which may differ materially from these estimates, will depend on several
      factors including whether contamination exists at all sites, the nature and
      extent of contamination and the level of remediation that may be required.
        Other
      factors that may affect such costs include, but are not limited to, changes
      in
      remediation technology, fluctuations in unit costs and changes in environmental
      laws and regulations.   With
      respect to certain sites or portions of sites, the subsidiaries have received
      demands to investigate and remediate to extensive levels. Management does not
      believe that the utility subsidiaries are legally required to comply with such
      demands. However, if the subsidiaries were required to do so at all of the
      sites
      that have not been remediated, the Company currently estimates that its
      aggregate maximum potential liability would be approximately $420 million higher
      than the total of the recorded liabilities and estimates of additional
      reasonably possible costs indicated above. 

-
          98
          - 

Each
      subsidiary intends to seek contribution from other entities for the costs
      incurred at the sites, but the full extent of such contributions cannot be
      determined at this time.  

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas are recovering the costs of environmental activities
      relating to  
      the
      utilities  '
      former
      manufactured gas operations, including carrying charges on the unrecovered
      balances, under  
      rate
      mechanisms approved by the   Illinois
      Commerce Commission (Commission) which authorize recovery  
      of
  prudently  
      incurred  
      costs.
  Costs
      incurred in each fiscal year are subject to a prudence review by the Commission
      during a reconciliation proceeding for such fiscal year. Costs  
      are
      expensed in the statement of operations in the same period they are billed
      to
      customers and recognized as revenues. 

Management
      believes that any costs incurred by Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas for
      environmental activities relating to former manufactured gas operations that
      are
      not recoverable through contributions from other entities or from insurance
      carriers have been prudently incurred and are therefore recoverable through
      rates for utility service. Accordingly, management believes that the costs
      incurred by the subsidiaries in connection with former manufactured gas
      operations will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position
      or
      results of operations of the utilities. However, any changes in the utilities'
      approved rate mechanisms   for
      recovery of these costs, or any adverse conclusions  
      by the
  Commission
      with respect to the prudence  
      of
  costs
      actually  
      incurred  ,
      could
      materially affect the utilities' recovery of such costs through
      rates.    

B.
      Former Mineral Processing Site in Denver, Colorado   

      In
      1994,
      North Shore Gas received a demand from the S.W. Shattuck Chemical Company,
      Inc.
      (Shattuck), a responsible party under CERCLA, for reimbursement, indemnification
      and contribution for response costs incurred at Shattuck's Denver site. Shattuck
      is a wholly owned subsidiary of Salomon, Inc. (Salomon). The demand alleges
      that
      North Shore Gas is a successor to the liability of a former entity that was
      allegedly responsible during the period 1934-1941 for the disposal of mineral
      processing wastes containing radium and other hazardous substances at the site.
      In 1992, the EPA issued the ROD for the Denver site. The remedy selected in
      the
      ROD consisted of the on-site stabilization, solidification and capping of soils
      containing radioactive wastes. In 1997, the remedial action was completed.
      The
      cost of the remedy at the site has been estimated by Shattuck to be
      approximately $31 million. Salomon has provided financial assurance for the
      performance of the remediation of the site. 

North
      Shore Gas filed a declaratory judgment action against Salomon in the U.S.
      District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The suit asked the court
      to declare that North Shore Gas is not liable for response costs at the Denver
      site. Salomon filed a counterclaim for costs incurred by Salomon and Shattuck
      with respect to the site. In 1997, the district court granted North Shore Gas'
      motion for summary judgment, declaring that North Shore Gas is not liable for
      any response costs in connection with the Denver site. 

In
      1998,
      the United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, reversed the district
      court's decision and remanded the case for determination of what liability,
      if
      any, the former entity has, and therefore North Shore Gas has, for activities
      at
      the site. 

In
      1999,
      the EPA announced that it was reopening the ROD for the Denver site. The EPA's
      announcement followed a six-month scientific/technical review by the agency
      of
      the remedy's effectiveness. In 2000, the EPA amended the ROD to require removal
      of the radioactive wastes from the site to a licensed off-site disposal
      facility. The EPA estimates that this action will cost an additional $22.0
      million (representing the present worth of estimated capital costs and estimated
      operation and maintenance costs). 

In
      December 2001, Shattuck entered into a proposed settlement agreement with the
      United States and the State of Colorado regarding past and future response
      costs
      at the site. In August 2002, the agreement was approved by the District Court
      for the District of Colorado. Under the terms of the agreement, Shattuck agreed
      to pay, in addition to amounts already paid for response costs at the site,
      approximately $7.2 million in exchange for a release from further obligations
      at
      the site. The release will not apply in the event that new information shows
      that the remedy selected in the amended ROD is not protective of human health
      or
      the environment or if it becomes necessary to remediate contaminated groundwater
      beneath or emanating from the site. 

-
          99
          - 

The
      remediation of the site was completed in July 2006. According to U.S. EPA,
      all
      radioactive waste has been removed and the site has been deemed protective
      of
      human health and the environment. 

North
      Shore Gas does not believe that it has liability for the response costs, but
      cannot determine the matter with certainty. At this time, North Shore Gas cannot
      reasonably estimate what range of loss, if any, may occur. In the event that
      North Shore Gas incurs liability, it would pursue reimbursement from insurance
      carriers, other responsible parties, if any, and through its rates for utility
      service. 

C.
      Other   

The
      Company has identified other sites on which the Company s subsidiaries, their
      predecessors and affiliates have conducted operations which may have resulted
      in
      releases of contaminants to the soil and groundwater. While the Company does
      not
      expect to be required to investigate or remediate these sites, it cannot
      determine the matter with certainty. In the event that the Company incurs costs
      in connection with the investigation or remediation of these sites, it would
      seek reimbursement from other responsible parties, if any, and, if appropriate,
      through the utilities  rates for utility services.

      GAS
      CHARGE RECONCILIATION PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED MATTERS  

A.
      Illinois Commerce Commission Proceedings   

      For
      each
      utility subsidiary, the Commission conducts annual proceedings regarding the
      reconciliation of revenues from the Gas Charge and related gas costs. In these
      proceedings, the accuracy of the reconciliation of revenues and costs is
      reviewed and the prudence of gas costs recovered through the Gas Charge is
      examined by interested parties. If the Commission were to find that the
      reconciliation was inaccurate or any gas costs were imprudently incurred, the
      Commission would order the utility to refund the affected amount to customers
      through subsequent Gas Charge filings. The proceedings are initiated shortly
      after the close of the fiscal year and historically take at least a year to
      18
      months to complete. 

The
      Commission issued orders on March 28, 2006, approving a settlement that resolved
      all proceedings regarding Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas for fiscal 2001 -
      2004
      costs. The recommendation that proceedings for Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas 
fiscal 2000 be reopened was made moot by approval of the settlement. The orders
      adopted a January 17, 2006 Settlement Agreement and Release among and between
      Peoples Energy, Peoples Gas, Peoples MW, LLC, Peoples Energy Resources Company,
      LLC and North Shore Gas (collectively, the Peoples Companies), the People of
      the
      State of Illinois through Lisa Madigan, Illinois Attorney General (AG), the
      Chicago and the Citizens Utility Board, as amended by an Amendment and Addendum
      dated March 6, 2006 (the Agreement).  

The
      Agreement provides for the following: 

(i)   

Peoples
                Gas and North Shore Gas agreed to refund the total sum of $100 million
                to
                their customers (the Refund). In its orders approving the Agreement,
                the
                Commission determined that $96 million should be refunded to customers
                of
                Peoples Gas and $4 million should be refunded to customers of North
                Shore
                Gas. Pursuant to the orders, on April 6, 2006, Peoples Gas and North
                Shore
                Gas filed informational statements with the Commission showing the
                amount
                of the refund to various customer classes. In April 2006, the refund
                was
                credited to customer accounts. 

(ii)  

Peoples
                Energy agreed to pay to the City and the AG, jointly $5 million.
                The
                Company also agrees to pay up to $5 million per year over the next
                five
                years towards the funding of conservation and weatherization programs
                for
                low and moderate-income residential dwellings (Conservation Programs).
                The
                five subsequent payments of up to $5 million shall be paid based
                upon
                Conservation Programs to be developed by the City of Chicago and/or
                the
                Illinois Attorney General. The Conservation Programs will have the
                purpose
                of providing energy and natural gas conservation programs for residents
                within Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas 

-
          100
          - 

service
                areas and will have the goal of reducing those residents  energy usage and
                costs. Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas will not seek recovery in
                any
                future rate or reconciliation cases of any amounts associated with
                the
                Conservation Programs. 

(iii) 

Peoples
                Gas and North Shore Gas agreed to forgive all outstanding bad debt
                from
                fiscal years 2000-2005 existing as of March 6, 2006, estimated at
                $207
                million, remove the bad debt from customers  records and to not use any
                forgiven indebtedness as a reason to deny gas service. Peoples Gas
                and
                North Shore Gas have written off the estimated $207 million in prior
                periods. The Agreement does not affect the ability of Peoples Gas
                and
                North Shore Gas to recover any future bad debts as specifically authorized
                by the Commission now or in the future.

(iv) 

Peoples
                Gas and North Shore Gas will cooperate with Chicago and the AG to
                identify
                those customers of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas who were not receiving
                gas as of the date of the Agreement (approximately 12,000 customers)
                that
                are financial hardship cases. The hardship cases may be identified
                by
                either the utilities or the AG and Chicago. Following identification,
                Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas will reconnect the hardship cases.
                Peoples
                Gas and North Shore Gas will also forgive all outstanding debt for
                such
                customers, as described in paragraph (iii) above.

(v)  

Peoples
                Gas and North Shore Gas agree to credit fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006
                revenues derived from the provision of gas Hub services as an offset
                to
                utility customers  gas charges and to account for such revenues received
                from gas Hub services in the same manner in all future gas charge
                reconciliation cases. The fiscal 2006 revenues are being credited
                in
                fiscal 2006. The fiscal 2005 revenues are expected to be credited
                to
                customers following an order in the fiscal 2005 gas charge reconciliation
                case. For fiscal 2005 and 2006, only Peoples Gas had Hub revenues.

(vi) 

Peoples
                Gas and North Shore Gas agreed to implement recommendations proposed
                by
                the Commission s staff and the intervenors to conduct internal and
                external audits of their gas procurement practices.

The
      terms
      of the Agreement expressly provide that nothing in the Agreement, or any acts
      performed or documents executed in furtherance of the Agreement, shall
      constitute or may be used as an admission of liability against Peoples Energy
      or
      its utility subsidiaries. The Commission s orders effectively adopted the
      provisions of the Agreement as a resolution on the merits of the differences
      between the parties concerning the gas charge reconciliation matters related
      to
      the years 2000 through 2004 for Peoples Energy, Peoples Gas and North Shore
      Gas
      and also made other findings and conclusions.  

See
      Note
      2C for a summary of significant accounting matters related to the
      settlement. 

Fiscal
      2005 Gas Charge reconciliation cases were initiated in November 2005. Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas each filed direct testimony. These cases were heard
      and
      continued to February 22, 2007. Commission Staff and Intervener Direct Testimony
      is due January 18, 2007. The settlement of the prior fiscal years' Gas Charge
      reconciliation proceedings does not affect these cases, except for Peoples
      Gas'
      agreement to credit fiscal 2005 Hub revenues as an offset to   utility
      customers  gas charges  .

B.
      Class Action   

      In
      February 2004, a purported class action was filed in Cook County Circuit Court
      against the Company and Peoples Gas by Stephen Alport, a Peoples Gas customer,
      alleging, among other things, violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and
      Deceptive Business Practices Act related to matters at issue in Peoples Gas'
      fiscal year 2001 gas charge reconciliation proceedings. The suit seeks
      unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The Company and Peoples Gas
      deny
      the allegations and are vigorously defending the suit. Peoples Gas has been
      dismissed as a defendant and the only remaining counts of the suit allege
      violations of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act and that
      the Company acted in concert with others to commit a tortious act.  

Based
      upon the settlement and dismissal of Peoples Gas  fiscal years 2001 through 2004
      reconciliation cases by the ICC, the court on September 25, 2006 ruled to limit
      the potential class members in the suit seeking damages to  

-
          101
          - 

those
      persons who were customers during the time that Peoples Energy s joint venture
      with Enron was in operation and did not receive part of the settlement proceeds
      from the reconciliation cases. The court also denied Peoples Gas  motion to
      dismiss the case to the extent that the complaint seeks punitive damages (which
      could not have been obtained in the administrative reconciliation cases).
      Plaintiffs have filed a third amended complaint and a motion for class
      certification, to which the Company is in the process of responding. Management
      cannot predict the outcome of this litigation and has not recorded a liability
      associated with this contingency.  

9:
      OTHER
      LITIGATION  

A.
      Corrosion Control Inspection Proceeding   

State
      and
      federal law requires gas utilities to conduct periodic corrosion control
      inspections on natural gas pipelines. On April 19, 2006 the Commission initiated
      a citation proceeding related to such inspections that were required to be
      performed by Peoples Gas during 2003 and 2004, but which were not completed
      in
      the requisite timeframe.   On
      November 3, 2006, Peoples Gas and all intervening parties filed a stipulation
      to
      settle the Commission proceeding, and the Commission Staff separately filed
      in
      support of the stipulation. Under the stipulation, Peoples Gas agreed that
      it
      was not in compliance with applicable regulations, and further agreed to pay
      a
      penalty of $1 million, pay for a consultant to conduct a comprehensive
      investigation of its compliance with Commission pipeline safety regulations,
      become compliant with those regulations, not seek recovery in future rate cases
      of certain costs related to non-compliance and hold meetings with the City
      of
      Chicago to exchange information. If approved by the Commission, the stipulation
      will resolve only the Commission proceeding and does not constitute a release
      related to any civil or criminal laws. Peoples Gas has recorded a liability
      of
      $1 million associated with this settlement. 

On
      May
      16, 2006, the Attorney General of the State of Illinois served a subpoena
      requesting documents relating to Peoples Gas' corrosion inspections. Peoples
      Gas' counsel has met with representatives of the Attorney General s office and
      are providing documents relating to the subpoena. Management cannot predict
      the
      outcome of this investigation and has not recorded a liability associated with
      this contingency. 

On
      July
      10, 2006, the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois served a
      grand jury subpoena on Peoples Gas requesting documents relating to Peoples
      Gas'
      corrosion inspections. Peoples Gas' counsel has met with the U.S. Attorney's
      office and are providing documents relating to corrosion inspections.
      Discussions between the U.S. Attorney and counsel for Peoples Gas are ongoing.
      Management cannot predict the outcome of this investigation and has not recorded
      a liability associated with this contingency. 

B    .
      Builders Class Action   

In
      June
      2005, a purported class action was filed against the Company by Birchwood
      Builders, LLC in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois alleging that
      Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas were fraudulently and improperly charging fees
      to customers with respect to utility connections, disconnections, reconnections,
      relocations, extensions of gas service pipes and extensions of distribution
      gas
      mains and failing to return related customer deposits. The parties are
      attempting to resolve this matter through mediation. The Company, Peoples Gas
      and North Shore Gas also have filed two currently pending motions to dismiss
      the
      lawsuit. The Company and the utility subsidiaries believe  
      they
      have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend against the class
      action lawsuit. Management cannot predict the outcome of this litigation and
      has
      not recorded a liability associated with this contingency. 

10:
      OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

A.
      Guarantees and Letters of Credit   

      As
      of
      September 30, 2006, the Company had issued approximately $34.6 million of
      guarantees related to its unconsolidated equity investments as presented in
      the
      table below. In addition, the Company has authorized the issuance of standby
      letters of credit by financial institutions in the amount of $6.7 million as
      of
      September 30,  

-
          102
          - 

2006.
      Surety bonds totaling $1.6 million were issued by the Company as of September
      30, 2006. The Company enters into these arrangements to secure financing and
      facilitate commercial transactions by its investees and subsidiaries with third
      parties. The Company is not required to record liabilities associated with
      these
      obligations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. No such liabilities have
      been recognized as of September 30, 2006. 

(1) 

Based
                on the amount of the next semi-annual debt service payment as of
                September
                30, 2006. The amount of guarantee varies throughout the life of the
                loan,
                but cannot exceed $16.5 million. 

The
      Company's equity interests in Elwood have also been pledged as collateral for
      the benefit of Elwood's bondholders. 

At
      September 30, 2006, Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas had no material letters
      of
      credit or surety bonds and no outstanding guarantees.  

B.
      Purchase Commitments   

      Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas have purchase commitments for gas purchase, storage
      and
      transportation as well as materials, supplies, services and property, plant
      and
      equipment as part of the normal course of business. Certain contracts contain
      penalty provisions for early termination. The Company does not expect potential
      payments under these provisions to materially affect results of operations
      or
      its financial condition in any individual year. Purchase obligations are
      summarized below in Note 10D. 

C.
      Operating Leases   

      The
      Company and subsidiaries lease office space under agreements that expire in
      various years through 2016. During fiscal 2003, the Company extended the lease
      for its headquarters for an additional five years to August 31, 2014. The rental
      obligations consist of a base rent plus operating expenses and taxes. Rental
      expenses for the Company under operating leases were $8.3 million, $8.6 million
      and $8.7 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Rental
      expenses for Peoples Gas under operating leases were $2.6 million, $2.6 million
      and $3.6 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Rental
      expenses for North Shore Gas under operating leases were insignificant. The
      minimum rental commitments payable in future years under all noncancelable
      leases for the Company and Peoples Gas are summarized below in Note
      10D.

D.
      Contractual Obligations   

      The
      following table summarizes Peoples Energy s, Peoples Gas  and North Shore Gas 
minimum contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2006. 

(1) 

Includes
                interest on fixed and adjustable rate debt. The adjustable rate interest
                is calculated based on the indexed rate in effect at September 30,
                2006. 

(2) 

Includes
                gas purchases, storage, transportation, information technology-related
                and
                miscellaneous long-term and short-term capital purchase
                commitments. 

(3) 

Minimum
                pension funding is an estimate of the contributions that would be
                required
                pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to fund benefits
                earned as of October 1, 2006. Additional contributions may be made
                to fund
                benefits accruing after October 1, 2006, or on a discretionary
                basis. 

11:
      RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  

The
      Company and its subsidiaries participate in two noncontributory defined benefit
      pension plans, the Retirement Plan and the Service Annuity System, covering
      substantially all employees. These plans provide pension benefits that generally
      are based on an employee's length of service, compensation during the five
      years
      preceding retirement and social security benefits. Employees who began
      participation in the Retirement Plan July 1, 2001, and thereafter will have
      their benefits determined based on their compensation during the five years
      preceding termination of employment and an aged-based percentage credited to
      them for each year of their participation. The Company and its subsidiaries
      make
      contributions to the plans based upon actuarial determinations and in
      consideration of tax regulations and funding requirements under federal law.
      The
      Company also has a non-qualified pension plan (Supplemental Plan) that provides
      certain employees with pension benefits in excess of qualified plan limits
      imposed by federal tax law. Effective October 1, 2004, the Company began
      including amounts related to executive deferred compensation (EDC) in the
      calculation of supplemental pension expense. Retiring employees have the option
      of receiving retirement benefits in the form of an annuity or a lump sum
      payment. 

-
          104
          - 

The
      Company follows SFAS No. 88 to account for unrecognized gains and losses related
      to the settlement of its pension plans' Projected Benefit Obligations (PBO).
      During fiscal 2006, as in past fiscal periods, a portion of each plans' PBO
      was
      settled by the payment of lump sum benefits, resulting in a settlement cost
      under SFAS No. 88 for the Retirement Plan, Service Annuity System and
      Supplemental Plan. 

In
      addition, the Company and its subsidiaries currently provide certain
      contributory health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
      Substantially all employees may become eligible for such benefit coverage if
      they reach retirement age while working for the Company. These plans, like
      the
      pension plans, are funded based upon actuarial determinations, consideration
      of
      tax regulations and the Company's funding policy. The Company accrues the
      expected costs of such benefits over the service lives of employees who meet
      the
      eligibility requirements of the plan.

The
      asset
      allocation, by asset class, for the Company s pension and other postretirement
      benefit plans at the June 30 measurement date are as follows: 

The
      target asset allocation reflects the Company s investment strategy of maximizing
      the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an appropriate level of
      risk.
      Plan assets are rebalanced from time to time if the actual allocation deviates
      from the target by more than allowable limits as defined under the Company's
      investment policy. 

C.
      Funded Status   

The
      funded status of the plans, reconciled to the amount reported on the statement
      of financial position, is as follows: 

-
          106

The
      Company s Retirement Plan and Supplemental Plan had accumulated benefit
      obligations in excess of (less than) plan assets as of June 30, 2006 and 2005,
      as follows: 

Pretax
      amounts included in other comprehensive income arising from a change in the
      minimum liability are as follows:

      Expected Cash Flow   

      Information
      about the expected cash flows for the pension and other postretirement benefit
      plans follows: 

The
      above
      table reflects the total benefits expected to be paid from the plan or from
      Company assets and does not include the participants  share of the cost. The
      above expected benefit payments for other postretirement benefits include
      payments for prescription drug benefits and are net of the following expected
      Medicare Part D subsidy receipts:  

-
          107
          - 

E.
      Net Benefit Cost   

In
      fiscal
      2005 the Company recorded a combined $15.9 million noncash expense (before
      capitalization) for pension and other postretirement benefits associated with
      the restructuring described in Note 4. The $15.9 million included approximately
      $10.4 million related to effects of lump sum settlements and $5.5 million
      related to curtailment charges. In addition, remeasurement of the pension plan s
      liabilities and assets when the plan curtailment was recognized during the
      first
      quarter of fiscal 2005 resulted in an increase of $22.6 million in the minimum
      liability recognized in other comprehensive income. 

On
      December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
      Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription
      drug benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D) as well as a federal subsidy
      to
      sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is
      at
      least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. 

FSP
      No.
      106-2 provides accounting guidance to employers that have determined that
      prescription drug benefits available under their retiree health care benefit
      plans are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The FSP requires
      that the benefit attributable to past service be accounted for as an actuarial
      gain and the benefit related to current service be reported as a reduction
      in
      service cost. 

Detailed
      regulations needed to implement the Act were issued in January of 2005 and
      the
      Company determined that the benefits provided by its retiree health care benefit
      plans are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D and qualify for
      the
      federal subsidy. The impact of the Act on the Company's postretirement benefit
      plan was considered a significant event and a remeasurement of plan assets
      and
      obligations was performed as of February 28, 2005. The impact of the Act reduced
      accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $37.9 million related to

-
          108
          - 

benefits
      attributed to past service. The reduction in the components of net periodic
      benefit cost for 2006 and 2005 was as follows: 

F.
      Primary Actuarial Assumptions   

The
      Company utilized the assistance of its plan actuaries in determining the
      discount rate assumption. The Company s actuaries have developed an interest
      rate yield curve to enable companies to make judgments pursuant to EITF Topic
      No. D-36,  Selection of Discount Rates Used for Measuring Defined Benefit
      Pension Obligations and Obligations of Post Retirement Benefit Plans Other
      Than
      Pensions.  The yield curve is comprised of Aaa and Aa bonds with maturities
      between zero and thirty years. The plan actuaries then discount the expected
      annual benefit cash flows for each of the Company s pension and retiree welfare
      plans using this yield curve and develop a single-point discount rate matching
      each plan s expected payout structure. 

The
      Company establishes its expected return on asset assumption based on
      consideration of historical and projected asset class returns. For each asset
      class, the expected return is calculated as the weighted-average of the
      historical and projected returns, as determined by an independent source. This
      amount is then compared to the historical investment performance of the Trust
      as
      well as a group of peer companies for reasonableness.

Assumed
      health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
      for the health care plans. For fiscal 2006 a one-percentage-point change in
      the
      assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following

G.
      Defined Contribution Plans   

      In
      addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company has defined
      contribution plans that allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of
      their income in accordance with specified guidelines. The Company matches a
      percentage of the employee contribution up to certain limits. The cost of the
      Company s matching contribution to the plans totaled $3.7 million, $3.6 million
      and $4.0 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

        continuing operations .

The
        increase in the state income tax rate in fiscal 2006 is due to the impact
        of
        Illinois tax benefits relative to the Company s disproportionately smaller
        consolidated loss before income taxes caused by taxable income in states
        other
        than Illinois. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization
        Act
        of 2003 (see Note 11E) excludes receipt of the subsidy from taxable income
        of
        the employer for federal income tax purposes. Certain transaction costs incurred
        to facilitate a merger are   estimated
        to be non-deductible for tax purposes. (See Note 1 for a discussion of the
        proposed merger between the Company and WPS Resources. )

As
      of
      September 30, 2006, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
      carryforwards of approximately $5.9 million and $4.7 million, respectively,
      which, if unused, will expire in 2026 and 2018, respectively. 

The
      Company records a reserve for uncertain tax positions based upon its assessment
      of the probabilities that certain deductions or income tax positions may not
      be
      sustained when income tax returns are audited by taxing
      jurisdictions.  The reserves recorded at September 30, 2006 and 2005 are
      not material to the consolidated financial statements.

      DEBT COVENANTS   

North
      Shore Gas  indenture relating to its first mortgage bonds contains provisions
      and covenants restricting the payment of cash dividends and the purchase or
      redemption of capital stock. At September 30, 2006, such restrictions
      amounted to $6.9 million out of North Shore Gas  total retained earnings of
      $76.3 million. 

The
      Company has revolving credit facilities which primarily support its commercial
      paper borrowing. These credit facilities provide that the lenders under such
      facilities may terminate the credit commitments to the borrowing company and
      declare any outstanding amounts due and payable if the borrowing company s
      debt-to-total capital ratio excluding the impact of accumulated other
      comprehensive income (AOCI), exceeds 65%. At September 30, 2006, this
      ratio, as defined in the credit facilities, was 58% for Peoples Energy and
      44%
      for Peoples Gas. 

The
      Company s indenture relating to its $325.0 million notes due
      January 15, 2011, has a cross-default provision relating to any other
      indebtedness greater than $15.0 million. The Company s five-year revolving
      credit facilities have a cross-default provision relating to any other
      indebtedness greater than $15.0 million. Peoples Gas  five-year revolving
      credit facilities have a cross-default provision relating to any other
      indebtedness greater than $15.0 million. 

The
      Indenture of Mortgage, dated January 2, 1926, as supplemented, securing the
      First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds issued by Peoples Gas, constitutes a direct,
      first-mortgage lien on substantially all property owned by Peoples Gas. The
      Indenture, dated April 1, 1955, as supplemented, securing the first
      mortgage bonds issued by North Shore Gas, constitutes a direct, first-mortgage
      lien on substantially all property owned by North Shore Gas. 

14:
      LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM DEBT  

Peoples
      Gas and North Shore Gas utilize mortgage bonds to secure tax exempt interest
      rates. The Illinois Finance Authority has issued tax exempt bonds for the
      benefit of Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas and Chicago has issued tax exempt
      bonds for the benefit of Peoples Gas. Each issuance is secured by an equal
      principal amount of Peoples Gas  or North Shore Gas  first mortgage
      bonds. 

A.
      Changes in Debt Securities   

      During
      fiscal 2005, the Company took advantage of the low interest rate environment
      to
      refinance existing higher interest rate debt. During fiscal 2004, the Company
      took advantage of the low interest rate environment to term-up adjustable rate
      debt. In general, debt classified as short-term due to the technical tender
      provisions was replaced by long-term debt. 

Peoples
      Gas has $51.0 million of Adjustable Rate, Series OO bonds, due October 1, 2037
      and $51.0 million of Adjustable rate, Series PP bonds, due October 1, 2037
      outstanding, which currently are in a 35-day period Auction Rate Mode. Fiscal
      2006 weighted-average interest rate was 3.17% and 3.29% for Series OO and PP,
      respectively.

          - 

The
      following table summarizes the fiscal 2005 and 2004 changes in the composition
      of the Company s debt. 

On
      June
      13, 2006, the Company entered into a 5-year syndicated revolving credit
      agreement with twelve financial institutions that provides backup for the
      Company s commercial paper borrowing program. The maximum amount that may be
      borrowed under the credit agreement is $400 million. This replaces the
      previous $225 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire in March
      2007. 

On
      July 12, 2005, Peoples Gas entered into a 5-year syndicated revolving
      credit agreement with eleven financial institutions that provides backup for
      Peoples Gas  seasonal commercial paper borrowing program. The maximum amount
      that may be borrowed under the credit agreement is $250 million. This
      replaced the previous $200 million credit facility that was scheduled to
      expire in August 2005. 

B.
      Short-Term Debt   

      The
      following table presents a detail of short-term debt by type. 

-
          115
          - 

Short-term
      cash needs of Peoples Energy are met through bank loans or the issuance of
      short-term debt. The outstanding total amount of commercial paper and bank
      loans
      under the revolving credit facilities cannot at any time exceed total bank
      lines
      of credit then in effect. At September 30, 2006, the Company and its
      subsidiaries had combined lines of credit totaling $650 million. Of those
      lines Peoples Energy Corporation had lines of credit totaling $400 million,
      of which $89.6 million of credit was available. The agreements for the
      $400 million will expire June 2011. Such lines of credit cover the
      projected short-term credit needs of the Company. Payment for the lines of
      credit is by fee. In addition, at September 30, 2006, the Company had
      approximately $6.7 million of letters of credit outstanding for financial
      and performance guarantees. 

On
      October 20, 2006, the Company entered into (1) a $25 million revolving credit
      agreement with ABN AMRO Bank, N.V.; (2) a $25 million revolving credit agreement
      with Bank of America, N.A.; and (3) a $25 million revolving credit agreement
      with JPMorgan Chase Bank to provide for potential seasonal liquidity needs.
      Each
      credit agreement is effective from October 20, 2006 through the earlier of
      (i)
      March 31, 2007 or (ii) the consummation of the merger between a subsidiary
      of
      WPS Resources Corporation and Peoples Energy. Funds may be used for general
      corporate purposes and commercial paper back-up. 

Short-term
      cash needs of Peoples Gas are met through inter-company loans from the Company,
      inter-utility loans from North Shore Gas, bank loans or the issuance of
      commercial paper. The outstanding total amount of commercial paper and bank
      loans under the revolving credit facilities cannot at any time exceed total
      bank
      lines of credit then in effect. At September 30, 2006, Peoples Gas had
      aggregate available lines of $250 million all of which was available.
      Agreements covering these lines expire in July 2010. In addition, at
      September 30, 2006 and 2005, Peoples Gas had approximately
      $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of letters of credit
      outstanding for financial and performance guarantees. The credit facilities
      of
      the Company and Peoples Gas are expected to be renewed when they expire,
      although the exact amount of the renewals will be evaluated at that time and
      may
      change from the current levels. 

North
      Shore Gas  short-term cash needs are met through loans from the Company and/or
      inter-utility loans from Peoples Gas, which are sufficient resources to meet
      working capital requirements. At September 30, 2006, North Shore had no
      loans outstanding. 

15:
      EARNINGS PER SHARE  

The
      following table summarizes average and diluted shares for computing the
      Company s per-share amounts. The dilution is attributable to stock options and
      performance shares outstanding under the Company s LTIC and DSOP. The diluted
      shares for the Company are as follows: 

For
      fiscal 2006, all outstanding options and performance shares were excluded from
      the computation of diluted loss per share because inclusion would be
      antidilutive. 

16:
      PREFERRED STOCK  

The
      Company has five million shares of Preferred Stock, no par value,
      authorized for issuance, of which none were issued and outstanding at
      September 30, 2006. 

-
          116
          - 

Peoples
      Gas has 430,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $100 par value, authorized
      for issuance, of which none were issued and outstanding at September 30,
      2006. North Shore Gas has 160,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $100 par
      value, authorized for issuance, of which none were issued and outstanding at
      September 30, 2006. 

17:
      COMMON STOCK AND STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS  

Common
      Stock   

      The
      Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for
      the issuance from time to time of up to 1.5 million shares of common stock
      pursuant to a continuous equity offering in one or more negotiated transactions
      or  at-the-market  offerings. Since the Form S-3 was filed in 2002 and through
      September 30, 2006, 1,235,700 shares of common stock have been issued
      through the continuous equity offering. Proceeds, net of issuance costs, totaled
      $47.9 million. 

In
      addition, the Company issues common stock through other plans such as the Direct
      Purchase and Investment Plan and ESPP. In early fiscal 2003, the Company began
      issuing new shares from open market transactions to satisfy the requirements
      of
      the Direct Purchase and Investment Plan. Stock activity is summarized
      below. 

In
        fiscal
        2006, Peoples Gas issued   540,000
        shares of its common stock to the Company for $53.9 million.  

The
      2004
      Incentive Compensation Plan (Plan) is comprised of two sub-plans, the LTIC
      Plan
      and the Short-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. The Plan does not provide for
      the grant of stock options or SARs, as under the prior plan, but instead
      provides for the issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units and
      performance shares. All outstanding options from the prior plan became fully
      vested as of December 31, 2003, and no options or restricted stock units were
      subsequently granted. 

Under
      the
      Plan, up to 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock are available for
      issuance for awards under the LTIC Plan. However, no more than 350,000 shares
      may be granted for restricted stock and for awards of restricted stock
      units. 

Restricted
      stock awards are shares of the Company's common stock awarded to eligible
      employees and are subject to forfeiture. Restricted stock awards granted vest
      in
      equal annual increments over a five-year period from the  

-
          117
          - 

date
      of
      grant and are subject to forfeiture if the recipient fails to remain employed,
      other than by reason of death, disability or retirement on or after attaining
      age 65 (or such earlier date as determined by the Compensation Committee of
      the
      Board of Directors (Compensation Committee)), until the applicable vesting
      date.
      Additionally, in the event of a change in control any grants of restricted
      stock
      under the Plan will become immediately fully vested. Restricted stock awards
      have no exercise price and compensation cost is measured based upon the fair
      market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. Such cost
      is
      recognized as expense over the vesting period. 

A
      performance share is a contingent right to receive a share of common stock
      of
      the Company in the future, pursuant to the terms of a grant made under the
      Plan
      and the related award agreement. One or more performance goals and a performance
      cycle (period) of not less than one year is established for any grant of
      performance shares. At the expiration of the performance cycle, the Compensation
      Committee will determine the extent to which the performance goals were
      achieved. The Compensation Committee will then determine the number of
      performance shares to which a recipient of performance shares under the grant
      is
      entitled, based upon the number of performance shares originally granted to
      the
      recipient and the level of performance achieved. Performance shares will be
      settled by the delivery of shares of common stock of the Company as soon as
      practicable after the close of the performance cycle. 

If
      a
      performance share recipient's employment with the Company terminates other
      than
      by reason of death, disability, or retirement on or after attaining age 65
      (or
      such earlier date as determined by the Compensation Committee) prior to the
      last
      day of a performance cycle, the recipient will forfeit the performance shares
      granted with respect to such performance cycle. If a performance share
      recipient's employment with the Company terminates by reason of death or
      disability prior to the last day of a performance cycle, the performance goals
      for the recipient's performance shares will be deemed to have been achieved
      at
      target levels, and the recipient will be entitled to a pro rata distribution
      of
      shares of common stock in settlement of the performance shares. If a performance
      share recipient's employment with the Company terminates by reason of retirement
      on or after attaining age 65 (or such earlier date as determined by the
      Compensation Committee) prior to the last day of a performance cycle, the
      recipient will be entitled to a pro rata distribution of shares of common stock
      in settlement of the performance shares, based upon the performance goals
      achieved. If there is a change in control of Peoples Energy, the performance
      goals of all outstanding performance shares granted under the Plan will be
      deemed to have been achieved at target levels, and a recipient will be entitled
      to a pro rata distribution of shares of common stock in settlement of the
      performance shares, based on the number of months during the performance cycle
      that the recipient was employed by the Company, up to the date of the change
      in
      control. Performance shares have no exercise price. 

Under
      the
      Plan, performance goals may be based on various criteria measuring the
      performance of the Company generally or relative to peer company performance,
      and may be based on a comparison of actual performance during a performance
      period against budget for such period. 

The
      Company's prior plan awarded grants of options enabling the recipient to
      purchase Company common stock at a price equal to the fair market value of
      the
      shares on the date the option was granted. The grant of a SAR enables the
      recipient to receive, for each SAR granted, cash in an amount equal to the
      excess of the fair market value of one share of Company common stock on the
      date
      the SAR is exercised over the fair market value of one share on the date the
      SAR
      was granted. Before an option or SAR may be exercised, the recipient must
      generally complete 12 months of continuous employment subsequent to the grant
      of
      the option or SAR. Options and SARs may be exercised within 10 years from the
      date of grant, subject to earlier termination in case of death, retirement or
      termination of employment for other reasons. 

The
      Company also offers employees periodic opportunities to purchase shares of
      its
      common stock at a discount from the then current market price under its ESPP.
      As
      of November 30, 2006, the Company may sell up to 853,312 shares of common stock
      to its employees under the ESPP. Under the terms of this plan, all employees
      are
      eligible to purchase shares at 90% of the stock's market price at the date
      of
      purchase. 

-
          118
          - 

As
      a
      result of the merger agreement between the Company and WPS Resources, it is
      necessary to limit the amount of stock that employees not covered under
      collective bargaining agreements can purchase under the ESPP. Therefore,
      effective September 1, 2006: (1) employees currently enrolled in payroll
      deduction cannot increase the payroll deduction for the plan from what it was
      on
      July 8, 2006; (2) participation in the plan can only be done through payroll
      deductions; no other forms of payment will be accepted; and (3) employees who
      did not participate in payroll deduction on July 8, 2006 and new employees
      cannot purchase stock under the ESPP.  

If
      the
      merger with WPS Resources becomes probable of occurring, the change in control
      provisions for the stock awards described above would become effective. See
      Note
      1 for further discussion regarding the merger.  

Nonemployee
      directors participate in the Company's DSOP. Under the DSOP, as amended by
      the
      Board of Directors in December 2002, each nonemployee director of the Company
      will receive, as part of his or her annual retainer, an annual award of 1,000
      deferred shares of common stock of the Company. With certain exceptions under
      the DSOP, shares are automatically deferred until the director's retirement.
      The
      director is entitled to receive amounts representing dividends from such
      deferred shares equal to dividends paid with respect to a like number of shares
      of common stock of the Company. Compensation expense is based upon the fair
      market value of the Company's common stock at the date of issuance. 

Nonemployee
      directors also have an opportunity to defer their compensation in the form
      of
      cash or Company common stock. Compensation expense in the form of common stock
      is based upon the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date
      of
      issuance. 

The
      Company has a policy of issuing additional shares to satisfy the exercises
      or
      conversions under its share-based compensation arrangements. 

Effective
      October 1, 2005, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 (R), requiring compensation
      costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the
      financial statements. Compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date
      fair
      value of the equity or liability instrument issued. In addition, liability
      awards are remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized
      over the period that the employee provides service in exchange for the award.
      SFAS No. 123 (R) replaces SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25.

The
      Company applied the modified prospective method of adopting SFAS No. 123 (R),
      which requires the new standard to be applied to unexercised SARs and unvested
      performance shares as of October 1, 2005 and prospectively. The method requires
      SFAS No. 123 (R) to be applied prospectively to the ESPP, new awards under
      the
      Plan and existing awards if modified, repurchased or cancelled. 

Adoption
      of SFAS No. 123 (R) resulted in the Company recognizing immaterial compensation
      expense upon adoption and related primarily to the Company's unvested
      performance shares and unexercised SARs. 

Share-based
      employee compensation expense relative to ESPP, performance shares, SARs, RSAs
      and directors fees paid in stock included in reported net income for the fiscal
      years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (prior years not restated for
      adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R)) totaled $4.0 million, $2.0 million and $1.8
      million, respectively (tax benefit of $1.6 million, $0.8 million and $0.7
      million, respectively). 

There
      were 15,590, 12,228 and 13,244 shares sold through the ESPP for the fiscal
      years
      ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Had compensation cost
      for
      shares issued under the ESPP been determined consistent with the requirements
      under the prior SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effect on the Company's 2005 and
      2004 net income and earnings per share would not be material. 

Prior
      to
      the adoption of SFAS No. 123 (R), the Company s SARs were recorded at intrinsic
      value. As the Company's SARs meet the SFAS No. 123 (R) definition of a
      share-based liability, the fair value of each SAR award is estimated on the
      date
      of grant and updated on a quarterly basis using the Black-Scholes-Merton
      valuation model. Compensation expense for SARs is recognized over the vesting
      period. The model uses the assumptions in  

-
          119
          - 

the
      following table. The expected term of the SARs represents the period of time
      the
      granted SARs are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience,
      subject to remaining contractual term. The risk-free rate for periods within
      the
      contractual life of the SARs is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
      at the time of the grant or subsequent quarter-end measurement
      date. 

At
      September 30, 2006, 134,075 total performance shares were outstanding and
      remained unvested under the Plan for the 2004-2006, 2005-2007 and 2006-2008
      performance cycles. As vesting and conversion of performance shares to Company
      common stock depends upon achieving certain goals represented by a combination
      of market and performance measures, the Company estimated the fair value of
      such
      awards based on historical input into a Monte Carlo simulation model, three
      year
      business plan data and grant date fair market value of the Company's common
      stock. The calculated compensation cost is recognized as expense over each
      of
      the respective three-year cycles. In December 2006 it was determined that no
      performance shares granted under the 2004-2006 cycle had vested.

A
      summary
      of the status of the Company's nonvested shares as of September 30, 2006 is
      presented below: 

As
      of
      September 30, 2006, there was $4.6 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under
      the Plan, assuming no Company merger with WPS Resources. That cost would be
      recognized over a period of 5 years. 

The
      Company s long-term incentive compensation plans provide for accelerated vesting
      of restricted stock awards and for accelerated vesting at target levels for
      performance shares in the event of a change in control. When the merger with
      WPS
      Resources becomes probable of occurring, the Company will be required to
      recognize compensation expense of approximately $5.2 million representing higher
      levels for performance shares (including cumulative amounts for all outstanding
      performance shares) and a shorter vesting period for restricted stock than
      under
      current expense recognition methods.

      QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)  

Quarterly
      financial data does not always reveal the trend of the Company s business
      operations due to nonrecurring items and seasonal weather patterns which affect
      earnings, and related components of net revenues and operating income.

In
      the
      third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded pre-tax
      merger-related expenses of $1.9 million ($1.1 million or $0.03 per diluted
      share
      after taxes) and $7.0 million ($6.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share after
      taxes), respectively. 

In
      the
      first and second quarters of fiscal 2006, the Company recorded pre-tax charges
      of $91.7 million ($55.2 million or $1.44 per diluted share after taxes) and
      $15.7 million ($9.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share after taxes),
      respectively, for settlement of utility gas charge proceedings for fiscal years
      2001 through 2004, as well as related civil litigation. Of these amounts,
      Peoples Gas recorded pre-tax charges of $74.7 million ($45.0 million after
      taxes) and $28.4 million ($17.1 million after taxes) in the first and second
      quarters of fiscal 2006, respectively. North Shore Gas recorded a pre-tax charge
      of $17.0 million ($10.2 million after taxes) in the first quarter of fiscal
      2006
      and a pre-tax credit of $(12.7) million ($(7.7) million after taxes) in the
      second quarter of fiscal 2006 reducing the accruals for the settlement made
      in
      earlier periods. 

In
      the
      first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company recorded pension-related restructuring
      costs of $11.2 million, a portion of which related to Peoples Gas ($7.0 million)
      and North Shore Gas ($0.5 million). See Note 4 for further discussion.

      SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURES (UNAUDITED)  

A.
      Results of Operations for Exploration and Production
      Activities   

      The
      following table summarizes revenue and direct cost information relating to
      the
      Company s oil and gas exploration and production activities. The Company has no
      long-term agreements to purchase oil or gas production from foreign governments
      or authorities.

      The

      DD A, including impairments, relating to the Company s oil and gas
      production, exploration and development activities. 

D.
      Costs Not Being Amortized   

      Following
      is a summary of costs excluded from the depletion base at September 30, 2006,
      by
      year incurred. The Company is unable to predict either the timing of the
      inclusion of these costs and the related natural gas and oil reserves in its
      depletion computation or their potential future impact on depletion
      rates. 

E.
      Reserve Quantity Information   

The
      Company s proved oil and gas reserve quantities are based on estimates prepared
      by third-party independent engineering consulting firms in conjunction with
      the
      Company s engineers, geologists and geophysicists in accordance with guidelines
      established by the SEC. The Company s estimates of proved reserve quantities of
      its properties are prepared by Netherland, Sewell   Associates, Inc., Miller
      and Lents, Ltd. and Prator Bett, L.L.C. Each year, Peoples Energy Production
      files estimates of oil and gas reserves with the U.S. Department of Energy
      on
      Form EIA-23. These estimates are consistent with the reserve data reported
      in
      this Note 19, with the exception that Form EIA-23 includes only gross reserves
      from properties operated by the Company. 

-
          127
          - 

Estimated
      quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and changes in net quantities
      of proved developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves were as
      follows: 

Oil
      and
      natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly. Estimates of oil and natural
      gas reserves require extensive judgments of geologic and reservoir engineering
      data and are generally less precise than other estimates made in connection
      with
      financial disclosures. 

Proved
      reserves are those quantities which, upon analysis of geological and engineering
      data, appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from
      known oil and natural gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating
      conditions. Proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected
      to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating
      methods. Proved undeveloped reserves  

-
          128
          - 

are
      those
      reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage
      or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
      required. 

Assigning
      monetary values to such estimates, which require extensive judgment, does not
      reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The
      uncertainties inherent in the disclosure of oil and gas reserves are compounded
      by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and
      the
      costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. The
      information set forth herein is therefore subjective and, since judgments are
      involved, may not be comparable to estimates submitted by other oil and natural
      gas producers. In addition, since prices and costs do not remain static and
      no
      price or cost escalations or de-escalations have been considered, the results
      are not necessarily indicative of the estimated fair market value of estimated
      proved reserves nor of estimated future cash flows. 

F.
      Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein
      Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves   

      Future
      cash inflows are based on year-end cash prices for oil and gas and do not
      include the effects of hedges. Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes
      and future development costs are based on current costs with no
      escalation. 

The
      following table summarizes unaudited information concerning future net cash
      flows for oil and gas reserves, net of income tax expense. Income tax expense
      has been computed using expected future tax rates and giving effects to tax
      deductions and credits available, under current laws, and which relate to oil
      and gas producing activities. This information does not purport to present
      the
      fair market value of the Company s oil and gas assets, but does present a
      standardized measure of value disclosure concerning possible future net cash
      flows that would result under the assumptions used. 

The
      future net cash flows before income taxes for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 are
      $473.6 million, $1,597.6 million and $822.2 million, respectively, and after
      discounting at 10% are $240.5 million, $917.5 million, $502.4 million,
      respectively. 

In
      the
      foregoing determination of future cash inflows, sales revenues for gas and
      oil
      were based on cash prices at year-end. The year-end gas prices utilized for
      fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $4.18, $14.71 and $6.24 per MMbtu, respectively.
      Future costs of developing and producing the proved gas and oil reserves
      reported at the end of each year shown were based on costs determined at each
      such year-end, assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions. Future
      income taxes were computed by applying the appropriate year-end or future
      statutory tax rate to future pretax net cash flows, less the tax basis of the
      properties involved, and giving effect to tax deductions and permanent
      differences. Estimates of future liabilities and receivables applicable to
      oil
      and gas commodity hedges are not reflected in future cash flows from proved
      reserves as of the date of the reserve report.

Management s
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

The
      Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
      internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system
      is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of
      Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
      statements. 

All
      internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
      limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
      provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
      preparation and presentations. Also, the effectiveness of internal control
      over
      financial reporting may deteriorate in future periods due to either changes
      in
      conditions or declining levels of compliance with policies or
      procedures. 

The
      Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal
      control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006. In making this
      assessment, management used criteria set forth in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework   
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
      on this assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2006, the
      Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
      such
      criteria. 

Deloitte
        Touche LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, issued an audit
      report on management s assessment of the Company s internal control over
      financial reporting. This report appears below. 

Changes
      In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

      There
      were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting
      during the quarter ended September 30, 2006 that have materially affected or
      are
      reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over
      financial reporting.  

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm   

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders of 

      Peoples
      Energy Corporation  

      Chicago,
      Illinois 

We
      have
      audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's
      Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Peoples Energy
      Corporation and subsidiary companies (the  Company ) maintained effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on
      criteria established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework   
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
      Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
      over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
      control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
      on
      management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
      internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
      or
      under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
      financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
      the
      company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
      preparation of financial statements for external purposes in  

-
          131
          - 

accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
      over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements. 

Because
      of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
      including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
      controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
      or
      detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
      effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
      are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
      changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
      procedures may deteriorate.  

In
      our
      opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
      control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated,
      in
      all material respects, based on the criteria established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework   
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also
      in
      our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on
      the
      criteria established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework   
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
      Commission. 

We
      have
      also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets and
      consolidated capitalization statements of the Company as of September 30, 2006
      and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
      equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September
      30, 2006, and the financial statement schedules of the Company for each of
      the
      three years in the period ended September 30, 2006, and our report dated
      December 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
      and financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph
      regarding the Company s adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 47,
      "Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations".

      the Term, the Executive shall continue to receive his current salary in
      accordance with the Company s normal payroll procedures, subject to increase
      from time to time in accordance with salary increases generally granted to
      Company executives, and shall remain eligible to participate in all Company
      bonus programs, incentive arrangements and employee benefit plans for which
      he
      is eligible as of the Effective Date or thereafter in accordance with their
      terms.

      the
      termination of the Executive s employment for any reason other than Cause,
      within five (5) business days after such termination PEC shall pay to the
      Executive (or, if the Executive has died before receiving all payments to which
      he has become entitled hereunder, to the beneficiary or estate of the Executive
      as described in paragraph 12) the sum of his accrued but unpaid salary and
      accrued but unused paid time off for nonunion employees under the Paid Time

          - 

b.     Incentive
      Payments. 

The
      Executive shall be entitled to the following incentive payments if he remains
      employed with the Company through November 30, 2006 or dies or experiences
      a
      Disability that causes termination of his employment on or before that
      date: 

(i)
           one
      million dollars ($1,000,000) (less applicable tax withholdings) payable on
      December 1, 2006; and 

(ii)     one
      million seven hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($1,775,000) (less
      applicable tax withholdings) payable as soon as practicable following the date
      that is six months after the Executive s employment termination date, provided
      that he is not terminated for Cause. 

The
      incentive payments are in consideration of the Executive s agreement to and
      compliance with the terms set forth in paragraphs 4, 7, and 17 of this
      Agreement, provided that he complies with such terms and his employment is
      not
      terminated for Cause. PEC shall pay the designated amounts to the Executive
      (or,
      if the Executive dies before receiving the payments to which he has become
      entitled hereunder, to the beneficiary or estate of the Executive as described
      in paragraph 12) in lump sum cash payments.  
      If the
      Executive s employment is terminated for Cause after November 30, 2006 or he
      fails to agree to and comply with paragraphs 4, 7 and 17 of this Agreement,
      he
      shall forfeit his right to receive the incentive payment described in paragraph
      (ii) above.

      the
      Executive remains employed with the Company on: 

(i)
           the
      later
      of (A) the closing date of the Change in Control transaction under consideration
      on the Effective Date ( Project Score ), or (B) at the Company s option (with
      notice to be provided to the Executive before the closing of Project Score),
      the
      date that marks the three (3)-month anniversary of the closing of Project Score;
      or 

(ii)
           if
      Project Score is abandoned and does not close, the later of (A) the date
      PEC hires a new chief executive officer and he or she commences service in
      such
      position, or (B) at the Company s option (with notice to be provided to the
      Executive before the new chief executive officer commences service), the date
      that marks the three (3)-month anniversary of the new chief executive officer s
      first day of service in such position; 

or
      if the
      Company terminates the Executive s employment due to death, Disability or a
      reason other than Cause before the occurrence of an event described in (i)
      or
      (ii) above, then PEC shall pay to the Executive (or, if the Executive has died
      before receiving all payments to which he has become entitled hereunder, to
      the
      beneficiary or estate of the Executive as described in paragraph 12) a lump
      sum
      cash payment in the amount of two million dollars ($2,000,000), provided that
      the Executive complies with the terms of paragraph 7 of this Agreement. Such
      payment shall be made as soon as practicable following the date that is six
      months after the Executive s employment termination date. 

-
          4
          - 

d.     Retirement
      Benefits and Incentives. 

The
      Executive shall be entitled to receive any vested benefits credited or accrued
      on his behalf under any retirement plan, bonus program or incentive arrangement
      maintained by the Company, including, but not limited to, the PEC LTIC, the
      PEC
      Retirement Plan, the PEC SRB and the PEC STIC. Such benefits shall be
      distributed or paid in accordance with the respective provisions of such plans,
      programs or arrangements. To the extent required under Code Section 409A,
      certain benefit distributions or payments (not including benefits due under
      the
      Company s qualified retirement plans, such as the PEC Retirement Plan) may not
      be payable  
      before
      the date that is six months after the Executive s employment termination date.
      If the Executive s benefit payments under the PEC SRB are delayed for six months
      to comply with Code Section 409A and he elects an annuity form of distribution
      under that plan, the annuity payments that otherwise would have been payable
      during the six months immediately following the Executive s employment
      termination shall be aggregated and paid to the Executive all at once as soon
      as
      practicable following the date that is six months after the Executive s
      employment termination date. 

e.     Health
      Benefits. 

The
      Executive shall be entitled to any post-retirement health benefits for which
      he
      is eligible under the Company s welfare benefit plans (within the meaning of
      Section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
      ( ERISA )).  If the Executive is not retirement eligible, within the
      meaning of the Company s welfare benefit plans, at the time of his employment
      termination, the Company may provide health benefits through a fully insured
      health care or HMO plan.  PEC s obligations under this paragraph 3.e. shall
      cease on the earlier of (i) the date as of which such coverage ends in
      accordance with the Company s welfare benefit plan and (ii) the date
      following the termination of the Executive s employment as of which the
      Executive is eligible to receive benefits under welfare benefit plans (within
      the meaning of ERISA Section 3(1)) provided by an employer of the Executive
      other than the Company. 

4.     Source
      of
      Payments. 

a.     All
      payments provided for in paragraph 3 shall be paid in cash from the general
      funds of PEC; provided, however, that such payments shall be reduced by the
      amount of any payments made to the Executive or his dependents, beneficiaries
      or
      estate from any trust or special or separate fund established or utilized by
      PEC
      to assure such payments.  The Company shall not be required to establish a
      special or separate fund or other segregation of assets to assure such payments,
      and, if the Company makes any investments to aid it in meeting its obligations
      hereunder, the Executive shall have no right, title or interest whatever in
      or
      to any such investments except as may otherwise be expressly provided in a
      separate written instrument relating to such investments.  Nothing
      contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions,
      shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary
      relationship between the Company and the Executive or any other person.  To
      the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company
      such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured creditor of the
      Company.

b.     The
      Executive hereby waives the contribution requirement described in Section 1(f)
      of the Amended and Restated Trust under Peoples Energy Corporation Directors
      Deferred Compensation Plan, Directors Stock and Option Plan, Executive Deferred
      Compensation Plan and Supplemental Retirement Plan dated February 27, 2004

 Trust Agreement ) with respect to any benefits to which he may be entitled
      under the plans covered by the Trust Agreement. 

5.     Litigation
      Expenses; Arbitration. 

a.     PEC s
      obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise
      to
      perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any set-off,
      counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other claim, right or action which the
      Company may have against the Executive or others, except as set forth in
      paragraph 7.  In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other
      employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable
      to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement.  PEC agrees
      to pay, upon written demand therefor by the Executive, all legal fees and
      expenses which the Executive may reasonably incur as a result of any dispute
      or
      contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by or with the Company or others
      regarding the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision
      of this Agreement, plus in each case interest at the federal long-term rate
      in
      effect under Code Section 1274(d), compounded monthly.  In any such action
      brought by the Executive for damages or to enforce any provisions of this
      Agreement, the Executive shall be entitled to seek both legal and equitable
      relief and remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance of
      the
      Company s obligations hereunder, in his sole discretion.  The obligation of
      the Company under this paragraph 5 shall survive the termination for any reason
      of this Agreement (whether such termination is by the Company, by the Executive,
      upon the expiration of this Agreement or otherwise). 

b.     In
      the
      event of any dispute or difference between the Company and the Executive with
      respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the enforcement of rights
      hereunder, the Executive may, in his sole discretion by written notice to PEC,
      require such dispute or difference to be submitted to arbitration.  The
      arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by agreement of the parties or,
      if
      they cannot agree on an arbitrator or arbitrators within 30 days after the
      Executive has notified PEC of his desire to have the question settled by
      arbitration, then the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be selected by the
      American Arbitration Association (the  AAA ) in Illinois upon the application of
      the Executive.  The determination reached in such arbitration shall be
      final and binding on both parties without any right of appeal of further
      dispute.  Execution of the determination by such arbitrator may be sought
      in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The arbitrators shall not be bound
      by judicial formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of
      evidence and shall interpret this Agreement as an honorable engagement and
      not
      merely as a legal obligation.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any
      such arbitration shall take place in Illinois, and shall be conducted in
      accordance with the Rules of the AAA. 

6.     Tax
      Withholding. 

The
      Company may withhold from any payments made under this Agreement all federal,
      state or other taxes, including excise taxes as shall be required pursuant
      to
      any law or governmental regulation or ruling.

7.     Waiver
      and Releases. 

In
      consideration of the covenants under this Agreement, including, but not limited
      to, paragraphs 3 and 5, and as a condition precedent to receiving any payments
      under this Agreement, the Executive agrees to execute, concurrently with his
      employment termination, a release substantially in the form of Exhibit A and
      a
      Confidentiality Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B,
      respectively, attached hereto and by this reference made a part
      hereof. 

8.     Entire
      Understanding. 

This
      Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Company and the
      Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior
      agreement between the Company and the Executive providing for severance or
      similar benefits, except that this Agreement shall not affect or operate to
      reduce any benefit or compensation inuring to the Executive of any kind
      elsewhere provided and not expressly provided for in this
      Agreement. 

9.     Severability. 

If,
      for
      any reason, any one or more of the provisions or part of a provision contained
      in this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
      respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
      other provision or part of a provision of this Agreement not held invalid,
      illegal or unenforceable, and each other provision or part of a provision shall,
      to the fullest extent consistent with law, continue in full force and
      effect. 

10.     Consolidation,
      Merger, or Sale of Assets. 

If
      PEC
      consolidates or merges into or with, or transfers all or substantially all
      of
      its assets to, another corporation, limited liability company, limited
      partnership, or other entity, the term  the Company  as used herein shall
      include such other entity and this Agreement shall continue in full force and
      effect. 

11.     Notices. 

All
      notices, requests, demands and other communications required or permitted
      hereunder shall be given in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given

      Facsimile:
      (312) 240-4310 

or
      to
      such other address as either party shall have previously specified in writing
      to
      the other. 

12.     No
      Attachment. 

Except
      as
      required by law and as expressly provided in this paragraph 12, no right to
      receive payments under this Agreement shall be subject to anticipation,
      commutation, alienation, sale, assignment, encumbrance, charge, pledge or
      hypothecation or to execution, attachment, levy or similar process or assignment
      by operation of law, and any attempt, voluntary or involuntary, to effect any
      such action shall be null, void and of no effect.  Notwithstanding the
      preceding sentence, the Executive may, by giving written notice to PEC during
      the Executive s lifetime, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to whom the
      benefits described in paragraph 3 shall be transferred in the event of the
      Executive s death.  Any such designation may be revoked or changed by the
      Executive at any time and from time to time by similar written notice.  If
      there is no such designated beneficiary living upon the death of the Executive
      or if all such designated beneficiaries die prior to the receipt by the
      Executive of the referenced benefits, such benefits shall be transferred to
      the
      Executive s surviving spouse or, if none, then such benefits will be transferred
      to the estate or personal representative of the Executive.  If the Company,
      after reasonable inquiry, is unable to determine within twelve months after
      the
      Executive s death whether any designated beneficiary of the Executive did in
      fact survive the Executive, such beneficiary shall be conclusively presumed
      to
      have died prior to the Executive s death. 

13.     Binding
      Agreement. 

This
      Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the
      Executive and the Company and their respective permitted successors and
      assigns. 

14.     Modification
      and Waiver. 

This
      Agreement may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing
      signed by the parties hereto.  No term or condition of this Agreement shall
      be deemed to have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel against the
      enforcement of any provision of this Agreement except by written instrument
      signed by the party charged with such waiver or estoppel.  No such written
      waiver shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein,
      and each such waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition
      waived and shall not constitute a waiver of such term or condition for the
      future or as to any act other than that specifically waived. 

-
          8
          - 

15.     Headings
      of No Effect. 

The
      paragraph headings contained in this Agreement are included solely for
      convenience of reference and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
      interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 

16.     Governing
      Law. 

This
      Agreement and its validity, interpretation, performance, and enforcement shall
      be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without giving effect to the
      choice of law provisions in effect in such state. 

17.     Termination
      of Severance Agreement. 

The
      Severance Agreement is hereby terminated and no longer in effect as of the
      Effective Date. 

18.     Code
      Section 409A Compliance. 

No
      provision in this Agreement is intended to provide a deferral of compensation
      within the meaning of Code Section 409A.  Company and Executive agree that
      if and to the extent Code Section 409A applies to this Agreement, the Agreement
      shall be administered in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 409A
      so that there will not be a plan failure under Code Section 409A(a)(1), and
      all
      amounts payable hereunder shall be distributed only in compliance with the
      requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of such Code section, including,
      by
      way of example and without limitation, Code Section 409A(2)(A)(i), which
      prohibits the distribution of compensation subject to Code Section 409A to
      a
 specified employee  of a publicly traded company any earlier than six months
      after the date of separation of service in the case of a distribution by reason
      of separation of service.  No distribution shall be made under the
      Agreement that would fail to meet the requirements of Code Section
      409A. 

In
      addition, this Agreement is not intended to materially modify any deferred
      compensation plan of the Company that existed on October 3, 2004.  However,
      if this Agreement would otherwise be interpreted to be a material modification
      of any deferred compensation plan of the Company that existed on October 3,
      2004, as permitted by IRS Notice 2005-1, Q A-18(b), this Agreement shall be
      treated as material modification of such deferred compensation plan only as
      to
      the benefits provided by this Agreement and only the benefits provided by this
      Agreement shall be subject to Code Section 409A.

      omissions or matters occurring on or before the date hereof, including all
      claims arising from or relating in any way to the Executive s employment with
      the Company or the conclusion of such employment (whether such claims are

      not limited to, a release of any claims in tort or contract, including claims
      for wrongful discharge, breach of any employment contract or any other
      agreement, contract, practice or policy.  In addition to any other claims,

      having any bearing whatsoever on the terms and conditions of employment or
      termination of employment.  This Release shall not, however, constitute a
      waiver of any of the Executive s rights under the Employment and Retention
      Agreement or any rights he may have as a director or officer of the Company
      to
      indemnification under the Company s articles of incorporation or by-laws with
      respect to claims by third parties.  The Executive acknowledges that, in
      his decision to enter into this Release, he has not relied on any
      representations, promises or agreements of any kind, including oral statements
      by representatives of the Company, except as set forth in this
      Release.     

2.     Due
      Care. 

This
      Release contains a release of all claims under the Age Discrimination in
      Employment Act ( ADEA ) and, therefore, pursuant to the requirements of the
      ADEA, the Executive acknowledges that he has been advised (i) that this release
      includes, but is not limited to, all claims under the ADEA arising up to and
      including the date of execution of this release; (ii) to consult with an
      attorney and or other advisor of his choosing concerning his rights and
      obligations under this release; (iii) to fully consider this release before
      executing it, and that he has been offered ample time and opportunity, in excess
      of 21 days, to do so; and (iv) that this release shall become effective and
      enforceable 7 days following execution of this Release by the Executive, during
      which 7-day period the Executive may revoke his acceptance of this Release
      by
      delivering written notice to:  Corporate Secretary, Peoples Energy
      Corporation, 130 East Randolph Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60601. 

3.     No
      Assignment of Claims. 

The
      Executive represents and warrants that there has been no assignment or other
      transfer of any interest in any claim which the Executive may have against
      the
      Company.  The Executive agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless
      from any liability, claims, demands, damages, cost, expenses and attorney s fees
      incurred as a result of any person asserting such assignment or transfer of
      any
      rights or claims under any such assignment or transfer.  It is the
      intention of the Executive and the Company that this indemnity does not require
      payment as a condition precedent to recovery by the Company from the Executive
      under this indemnity.        

4.     Modification
      and Waiver. 

This
      Release may not be modified or amended except by an instrument in writing signed
      by the Executive and the Company.  No term or condition of this Release
      shall be deemed to have been waived, nor shall there be any estoppel against
      the
      enforcement of any provision of this Release except by written instrument signed
      by the party charged with such waiver or estoppel.  No such written waiver
      shall be deemed a continuing waiver unless specifically stated therein, and
      each
      such waiver shall operate only as to the specific term or condition waived
      and
      shall not constitute a waiver of such term or condition for the future or as
      to
      any act other than that specifically waived. 

5.     Governing
      Law. 

To
      the
      extent not governed by federal law, this Release and its validity,
      interpretation, performance, and enforcement shall be governed by the laws
      of
      the State of Illinois without giving effect to the choice of law provisions
      in
      effect in such state.

       AND

THIS
      CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ), effective as
      of _______________ ____, ______, by and between Peoples Energy Corporation,
      including any of its subsidiaries, affiliates and related entities (the
 Company ) and THOMAS M. PATRICK (the  Executive ). 

WITNESSETH 

WHEREAS,
      the Executive is an employee of the Company; 

WHEREAS,
      the Company and the Executive have entered into an employment and retention
      agreement dated August 31, 2006 (the  Employment and Retention Agreement ) under
      which the Company has covenanted to provide the Executive with certain payments
      and benefits in the event that the Executive s employment with the Company ends
      under the circumstances described therein; 

WHEREAS,
      in consideration of the Company s covenants under the Employment and Retention
      Agreement, and as a condition precedent to the Executive receiving any payments
      or benefits under the Employment and Retention Agreement, the Executive has
      agreed to execute a confidentiality agreement concurrently with his employment
      termination as described in the Employment and Retention Agreement; 

NOW,
      THEREFORE, as a condition precedent, and in consideration of the covenants
      by
      the Company to provide the Executive with the payments and benefits under the
      Employment and Retention Agreement, the Executive hereby agrees as follows:

1.     Confidential
      Information; Acknowledgement of Legitimate Business Interest of the
      Company.   

The
      Executive expressly recognizes and acknowledges that during his employment
      with
      the Company, he became entrusted with, had access to, or gained possession
      of
      confidential and proprietary information, data, documents, records, materials,
      and other trade secrets and/or other proprietary business information of the
      Company that is not readily available to competitors, outside third parties
      and/or the public, including without limitation, information about (i) current
      or prospective customers and/or suppliers, (ii) employees, research, goodwill,
      production, and prices, (iii) business methods, processes, practices or
      procedures; (iv) computer software and technology development, (v) the Company s
      hydrocarbon interests and prospects, and (vi) business strategy, including
      acquisition, merger and/or divestiture strategies (collectively or with respect
      to any of the foregoing, the  Confidential Information ).  The Executive
      further  

recognizes
      and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is the sole and exclusive
      property of the Company and that the Company has a legitimate interest in
      protecting its Confidential Information.    

2.     Non-Disclosure
      of Confidential Information. 

The
      Executive agrees that following his termination of employment, he shall keep
      and
      retain in confidence all Confidential Information and will not, without the
      consent of the Company, disclose or divulge any Confidential Information
      obtained during his employment with the Company to any third party for so long
      as the Confidential Information is valuable and unique, or until either the
      Company has either itself released the Confidential Information into the public
      domain or the Confidential Information has clearly become publicly available
      by
      means other than the Company or the Executive.  No individual piece of
      Confidential Information shall be deemed to have become publicly available
      merely because other pieces of Confidential Information shall have become
      publicly available, and no individual piece of Confidential Information shall
      be
      deemed to have become publicly available unless all of its substantive
      provisions shall have become publicly available.  This paragraph 2 shall
      not prevent the Executive from using general skills and experience developed
      in
      positions with the Company or other employers, or from accepting a position
      of
      employment with another company, firm, or other organization, provided that
      such
      position does not require divulgence or use of the Confidential
      Information. 

3.     Cooperation
      with the Company.   

If
      the
      Executive receives a subpoena or other judicial or administrative process
      demanding that he disclose Confidential Information ( Subpoena ), the Executive
      agrees that he will promptly notify the Company and cooperate fully with the
      Company if the Company elects to challenge or otherwise resist disclosure of
      the
      Confidential Information sought by the Subpoena.  Any such challenge or
      resistance by the Company shall be at the Company s own expense.  If the
      Executive promptly notifies the Company of the receipt of a Subpoena and the
      Company declines or fails to challenge or resist the Subpoena, or if after
      intervention by the Company in the judicial or administrative process, the
      Company is unsuccessful in quashing or opposing the disclosure, the Executive
      may produce the Confidential Information or respond to the Subpoena as he deems
      appropriate. 

4.     Return
      of
      Property   .  

The
      Executive understands and agrees that all business information, files, research,
      records, memoranda, books, lists and other documents and tangible materials,
      including computer disks, and other hardware and software that he receives
      during employment, whether confidential or not, are the property of the Company
      and that, immediately upon the termination of the Executive s employment, he
      will promptly deliver to the Company all such materials, including copies
      thereof, in his possession or under his control. 

5.     Non-Solicitation. 

The
      Executive covenants and agrees that for a period commencing on the date of
      the
      Executive s termination of employment with the Company and ending on the date
      that is one (1)  

-
          2
          - 

year
      after such employment termination date, the Executive shall not, directly or
      indirectly, solicit, induce, influence, or attempt to induce any employee of
      the
      Company to terminate his employment with, or compete against the Company or
      any
      present or future affiliates of the Company.  In particular, and without
      limiting the foregoing, the Executive agrees that during the one-year (1-year)
      period commencing on the Executive s employment termination date with the
      Company, the Executive shall not directly or indirectly attempt to hire any
      other employee of the Company or otherwise encourage any other employee to
      leave
      the employ of the Company, or (ii) advise or recommend to any other person
      that
      they employ or solicit for employment, any employee of the Company. 

6.     Equitable
      Relief. 

The
      Executive acknowledges that the Confidential Information to be disclosed to
      the
      Executive during his employment is of a special and unique character, and that
      the breach of any provision of this Agreement, including without limitation,
      its
      non-solicitation provision, will cause the Company irreparable injury and
      damage.  Accordingly, the Company shall be entitled, in addition to all
      other remedies available to it, to injunctive and equitable relief to prevent
      a
      breach of any part of this Agreement or to enforce any part of this
      Agreement.           

7.     Assignment. 

This
      Agreement is not assignable, in whole or in part, and shall not be assigned,
      by
      the Executive; and any purported assignment by the Executive shall be considered
      null and void.  This Agreement is assignable and may be so assigned by
      Employer, and this Agreement shall inure to the Benefit of, and shall be binding
      upon, any and all successors and assigns of the Company. 

8.     Entire
      Understanding. 

This
      Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Company and the
      Executive with respect to the subject matter hereof. 

9.     Severability. 

If,
      for
      any reason, any one or more of the provisions or part of a provision contained
      in this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
      any
      respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
      other provision or part of a provision of this Agreement not held invalid,
      illegal or unenforceable, and each other provision or part of a provision shall,
      to the fullest extent consistent with law, continue in full force and
      effect. 

10.     Consolidation,
      Merger, or Sale of Assets. 

If
      the
      Company consolidates or merges into or with, or transfers all or substantially
      all of its assets to, another corporation, the term  the Company  as used herein
      shall include such other corporation and this Agreement shall continue in full
      force and effect.

         Section
      2.7       Notice
      to the Lender   .
        The
      Borrower shall give notice to the Lender by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago
      time) (i) at least two (2) Business Days before the date on which the Borrower
      requests the Lender to advance a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans and (ii) at least
      one
      (1) Business Day before the date on which the Borrower requests the Lender
      to
      advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. The Loans included in each Borrowing
      shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such notice
      of a
      new Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect to change
      or
      continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to
      Section 2.4 s minimum amount requirement for each outstanding Borrowing, a
      portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of LIBOR Loans, on the
      last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower may continue
      part or all of such Borrowing as LIBOR Loans for an Interest Period or Interest
      Periods specified by the Borrower or convert part or all of such Borrowing
      into
      Base Rate Loans, (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business
      Day, the Borrower may convert all or part of such Borrowing into LIBOR Loans
      for
      an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the Borrower. The Borrower
      shall give all such notices requesting the advance, continuation, or conversion
      of a Borrowing to the Lender by telephone or   

9 

facsimile
      (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone, shall be
      promptly confirmed in writing). Notices of the continuation of a Borrowing
      of
      LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of part
      or
      all of a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans or of Base Rate Loans
      into LIBOR Loans must be given by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at
      least three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested continuation
      or
      conversion. All such notices concerning the advance, continuation, or conversion
      of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the requested advance, continuation
      or
      conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the
      requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued, or converted, the type of Loans
      to comprise such new, continued or converted Borrowing and, if such Borrowing
      is
      to be comprised of LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. The
      Borrower agrees that the Lender may rely on any such telephonic or facsimile
      notice given by any person it in good faith believes is an Authorized
      Representative without the necessity of independent investigation, and in the
      event any such notice by telephone conflicts with any written confirmation,
      such
      telephonic notice shall govern if the Lender has acted in reliance thereon.
      There may be no more than five different Interest Periods in effect at any
      one
      time, provided that for purposes of determining the number of Interest Periods
      in effect at any one time, all Base Rate Loans shall be deemed to have one
      and
      the same Interest Period.  

(a)       [Reserved]   
      . 

(b)       Borrower s
      Failure to Notify   . 
      Any outstanding Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall, subject to Section 6.2
      hereof, automatically be continued for an additional Interest Period on the
      last
      day of its then current Interest Period as a Base Rate Loan unless the Borrower
      has notified the Lender within the period required by Section 2.5(a) that it
      intends to convert such Borrowing into a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans or notifies
      the Lender within the period required by Section 2.8(a) that it intends to
      prepay such Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section
      2.5(a) above of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal
      amount of a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans before the last day of its then current
      Interest Period within the period required by Section 2.5(a) and has not
      notified the Lender within the period required by Section 2.8(a) that it intends
      to prepay such Borrowing, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into
      a
      Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, subject to Section 6.2 hereof.  

Section
      2.8        Interest
      Periods.    As
      provided in Section 2.5(a) hereof, at the time of each request to advance,
      continue, or create by conversion a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower
      shall
      select an Interest Period applicable to such Loans from among the available
      options. The term     Interest
      Period    
means
      the period commencing on the date a Borrowing of Loans is advanced, continued,
      or created by conversion and ending: (a) in the case of Base Rate Loans, on
      the
      last Business Day of the calendar quarter in which such Borrowing is advanced,
      continued, or created by conversion (or on the last day of the following
      calendar quarter if such Loan is advanced, continued or created by conversion
      on
      the last Business Day of a calendar quarter), and (b) in the case of LIBOR
      Loans, 1, 2 or 3 months thereafter;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      that: 

(a)      any
      Interest Period for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans that otherwise would end
      after the Termination Date shall end on the Termination Date;  

10 

(b)      for
      any
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower may not select an Interest Period that
      extends beyond the Termination Date; 

(c)      whenever
      the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be a day that is not a
      Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall be extended to the
      next
      succeeding Business Day, provided that, if such extension would cause the last
      day of an Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans to occur in the
      following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall be the
      immediately preceding Business Day; and 

(d)      for
      purposes of determining an Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans,
      a
      month means a period starting on one day in a calendar month and ending on
      the
      numerically corresponding day in the next calendar month;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      that if
      there is no numerically corresponding day in the month in which such an Interest
      Period is to end or if such an Interest Period begins on the last Business
      Day
      of a calendar month, then such Interest Period shall end on the last Business
      Day of the calendar month in which such Interest Period is to end. 

Section
      2.9        Maturity
      of Loans.    Unless
      an
      earlier maturity is provided for hereunder (whether by acceleration or
      otherwise), each Loan shall mature and become due and payable by the Borrower
      on
      the Termination Date.  

Section
      2.10        Prepayments. 
         Section
      2.11    The
      Borrower may prepay without premium or penalty and in whole or in part (but,
      if
      in part, then: (i) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, in an amount not
      less than $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof,
      (ii)
      if such Borrowing is of LIBOR Loans, in an amount not less than $2,000,000
      and
      integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) in an amount such
      that the minimum amount required for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof
      remains outstanding) any Borrowing of LIBOR Loans upon three Business Days 
prior notice to the Lender or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans,
      notice delivered to the Lender no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the
      date of prepayment, such prepayment to be made by the payment of the principal
      amount to be prepaid and accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for
      prepayment. In the case of LIBOR Loans, any amounts owing under Section 2.11
      hereof as a result of such prepayment shall be paid contemporaneously with
      such
      prepayment. Any amount paid or prepaid before the Termination Date may, subject
      to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be borrowed, repaid and borrowed
      again. 

(a)      At
      any
      time that the Borrower becomes aware, or should have become aware (pursuant
      to
      Borrower s ordinary business practices) that the aggregate amount of outstanding
      Loans shall at any time for any reason exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment
      then in effect, the Borrower shall, immediately notify the Lender of this
      determination. Within two (2) Business Days of the delivery of the notice
      described in the preceding sentence, the Borrower shall, without further notice
      or demand, pay the amount of such excess to the Lender as a prepayment of the
      Loans. Each such prepayment shall be accompanied by a payment of all accrued
      and
      unpaid interest on the Loans prepaid and shall be subject to Section
      2.11. 

Section
      2.12        Default
      Rate.    If
      any
      payment of principal on any Loan or other Obligation is not made when due
      (whether by acceleration or otherwise), such Loan shall bear interest (computed
      on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed or, if based on
      the
      rate described in clause (i) of the definition of Base Rate, on the basis of
      a
      year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and the actual number of days elapsed)
      from the date such payment was due until paid in full, payable on demand, at
      a
      rate per annum equal to: 

11 

(a)      for
      any
      Base Rate Loan or Obligation other than a LIBOR Loan, the sum of two percent
      (2%) plus the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect;
      and 

(b)      for
      any
      LIBOR Loan, the sum of two percent (2%) plus the rate of interest in effect
      thereon at the time of such default until the end of the Interest Period
      applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
      two
      percent (2%) plus the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time
      in
      effect. 

Section
      2.13        Evidence
      of Debt.    (a)
      Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or
      accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to Lender resulting from
      each Loan owing to Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal
      and interest payable and paid to Lender from time to time hereunder in respect
      of Loans. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by Lender to the Borrower to
      the
      effect that a Note is required or appropriate in order for Lender to evidence
      (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Loans owing
      to,
      or to be made by, Lender under the Credit Documents, the Borrower shall promptly
      execute and deliver to Lender a promissory note in the form of Exhibit A hereto
      (such promissory note is hereinafter referred to as the     Note    ).

Section
      2.14        Funding

      Lender
      shall incur any loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss,
      cost or expense (excluding loss of margin) incurred by reason of the liquidation
      or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by Lender to fund or
      maintain any LIBOR Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or
      amounts paid or prepaid to Lender) as a result of: 

(a)      any
      payment (whether by acceleration or otherwise), prepayment or conversion of
      a
      LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest
      Period, 

(b)      any
      failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Section 6 or otherwise)
      by the Borrower to borrow or continue a LIBOR Loan, or to convert a Base Rate
      Loan into a LIBOR Loan, on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to
      Section 2.5(a) or established pursuant to Section 2.5(c) hereof, 

(c)      any
      failure by the Borrower to make any payment of principal on any LIBOR Loan
      when
      due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or 

(d)      any
      acceleration of the maturity of a LIBOR Loan as a result of the occurrence
      of
      any Event of Default hereunder, 

then,
      upon the demand of Lender, the Borrower shall pay to Lender such amount as
      will
      reimburse Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If Lender makes such a claim
      for compensation, it shall provide to the Borrower a certificate executed by
      an
      officer of Lender setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in
      reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation
      of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate if
      reasonably calculated shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

      (5)
      Business Days  prior written notice to the Lender, to terminate the Revolving
      Credit Commitment without premium or penalty, in whole or in part, any partial
      termination to be in an amount not less than $2,000,000 and integral multiples
      of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,    provided   
      that the
      Revolving Credit Commitment may not be reduced to an amount less than the sum
      of
      the amount of all Loans then outstanding. Any termination of Revolving Credit
      Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.12 may not be reinstated. 

Section
      2.16        Regulation
      D Compensation.    The
      Lender may require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment
      of
      interest on the LIBOR Loans, additional interest on the related LIBOR Loans
      of
      Lender at a rate per annum equal to the excess of (i)(A) the applicable LIBOR
      rate (or other base rate determined pursuant to Section 2.9(b)) divided by
      (B)
      one minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage over (ii) the rate specified in clause
      (i)(A). Any computation by Lender of such additional interest shall be
      conclusive absent manifest error. If the Lender requires payment of such
      additional interest (x) it shall notify the Borrower that it is subject to
      LIBOR
      reserves under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
      System (or any successor regulation), in which case such additional interest
      on
      the LIBOR Loans of Lender shall be payable to Lender at the place indicated
      in
      such notice with respect to each Interest Period commencing at least five (5)
      Business Days after the giving of such notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower

      at the
      time of the making of any Loan hereunder, the interest rate payable hereunder
      in
      respect of such Loan is less than the rate (as determined by the Lender in
      consultation with the Borrower) at which funds of comparable term and amount
      are
      generally available to the Borrower in the commercial paper market (the
    CP
      Rate    )
      (an
    Arbitrage
      Condition    ),
      the
      Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender arbitrage compensation on such Loan at
      a
      rate equal to the difference between the effective interest rate payable
      hereunder (inclusive of all fees) in respect of such Loan and the CP Rate as
      applied to such Loan. Such payments shall continue, at the time and in the
      manner set forth for payments of interest on such Loan, for as long as the
      Arbitrage Condition continues. Upon the termination of the Arbitrage Condition
      for any reason (as determined by the Lender in consultation with the Borrower),
      such payments shall no longer be due with respect to such Loan, even if a future
      Arbitrage Condition were to occur prior to repayment in full of such
      Loan.

SECTION
      5.      REPRESENTATIONS
      AND WARRANTIES. 

The
      Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Lender as to itself and, where
      the following representations and warranties apply to Subsidiaries, as to each
      of its Subsidiaries, as follows: 

14 

Section
      5.1        Corporate
      Organization and Authority.    The
      Borrower is duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of
      the
      State of Illinois; has all necessary corporate power to carry on its present
      business; and is duly licensed or qualified and, in good standing in each
      jurisdiction in which the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
      standing would have a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section
      5.2        Corporate
      Authority and Validity of Obligations.    The
      Borrower has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and the
      other
      Credit Documents to which it is a party, to make the borrowings herein provided
      for, to issue its Notes in evidence thereof, and to perform all of its
      obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party. Each Credit
      Document to which it is a party has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
      by the Borrower and constitutes valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
      enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
      be
      limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
      affecting the enforceability of creditors  rights generally and by equitable
      principles of general applicability (regardless of whether such enforceability
      is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). No Credit Document, nor
      the
      performance or observance by the Borrower of any of the matters or things
      therein provided for, contravenes any provision of law or any charter or by-law
      provision of the Borrower or any material Contractual Obligation of or affecting
      the Borrower or any of its Properties or results in or requires the creation
      or
      imposition of any Lien on any of the Properties or revenues of the
      Borrower. 

Section
      5.3        Financial
      Statements.    All
      financial statements heretofore delivered to the Lender showing historical
      performance of the Borrower for each of the Borrower s fiscal quarters and/or
      years ending on or before June 30, 2006, have been prepared in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent, except
      as otherwise noted therein, with that of the previous fiscal year. Each of
      such
      financial statements fairly presents on a consolidated basis the financial
      condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
      the
      results of operations for the periods covered thereby. The Borrower and its
      Subsidiaries have no material contingent liabilities other than those disclosed
      in the financial statements or in comments or footnotes thereto, or in any
      report supplementary thereto, most recently furnished to the Lender as of the
      time such representation and warranty is made, including reports of the Borrower
      filed with the SEC from time to time. Since June 30, 2006 through the Effective
      Date, there has been no event or series of events which has resulted in a
      Material Adverse Effect. 

Section
      5.4        Approvals.
         No
      authorization, approval, consent, license, exemption, filing or registration
      with any court or governmental department, agency or instrumentality, nor any
      approval or consent of the stockholders of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
      from any other Person, is necessary to the valid execution, delivery or
      performance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Credit Document to which
      it
      is a party. 

Section
      5.5        ERISA.
         With
      respect to each Plan, the Borrower and each other member of the Controlled
      Group
      has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding standards of and is
      in
      compliance in all material respects with the Employee Retirement Income Security
      Act of 1974, as amended (    ERISA    ),
      and
      with the Code to the extent applicable to it and has not incurred any liability
      to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (    PBGC    )
      or a
      Plan under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums
      under Section 4007 of ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any
      contingent liabilities for any post-retirement benefits under a Welfare Plan,
      other than liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of Title
      I of
      ERISA. 

15 

Section
      5.6        Government
      Regulation.    Neither
      the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is an     investment
      company    
within
      the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

Section
      5.7        Margin
      Stock; Proceeds.    Neither
      the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is engaged principally, or as one of its primary
      activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing
      or
      carrying margin stock (    margin
      stock    
to
      have
      the same meaning herein as in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the
      Federal Reserve System). The Borrower will not use the proceeds of any Loan
      in a
      manner that violates any provision of Regulation U or X of the Board of
      Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Borrower is not subject to
      regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, the Borrower
      is not an  investment company  registered or required to be registered under the
      Investment Company Act of 1940. Proceeds of the Loans will only be used to
      backstop commercial paper issued by the Borrower and for general corporate
      purposes. 

Section
      5.8        Full
      Disclosure.    All
      information heretofore furnished by the Borrower to the Lender for purposes
      of
      or in connection with the Credit Documents or any transaction contemplated
      thereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by the Borrower to
      the
      Lender will be, to the best of the Borrower s knowledge, after due inquiry, true
      and accurate in all material respects and not misleading on the date as of
      which
      such information is stated or certified.

      Borrower shall fail within thirty (30) days to pay, bond or otherwise discharge
      any judgment or order for the payment of money in excess of $15,000,000 which
      is
      not stayed on appeal or otherwise being appropriately contested in good faith
      in
      a manner that stays execution thereon;

      any
      Event of Default other than those described in subsections (f) or (g) of Section

      declare the principal of and the accrued interest on the outstanding Note to
      be
      forthwith due and payable and thereupon the Note, including both principal
      and
      interest thereon, and all other Obligations, shall be and become immediately
      due
      and payable together with all other amounts payable under the Credit Documents
      without further demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind.

21 

Section
      8.3        Bankruptcy
      Defaults.    When
      any
      Event of Default described in subsections (f) or (g) of Section 8.1 hereof

      occurred and is continuing, then the Note shall immediately become due and
      payable together with all other amounts payable under the Credit Documents
      without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind and the obligation
      of
      the Lender to extend further credit pursuant to any of the terms hereof shall
      immediately terminate. 

Section
      8.4        Expenses.
         The
      Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender and any other holder of the Note, all
      costs
      and expenses incurred or paid by the Lender or any such holder, including

SECTION
      9.      CHANGE
      IN
      CIRCUMSTANCES. 

Section
      9.1        Change
      of Law.    Notwithstanding
      any other provisions of this Agreement or the Note, if at any time after the
      date hereof any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation
      thereof makes it unlawful for Lender to make or continue to maintain LIBOR
      Loans
      or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby, Lender shall promptly
      give
      notice thereof to the Borrower and Lender s obligations to make or maintain
      LIBOR Loans under this Agreement shall terminate until it is no longer unlawful
      for Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Loans. The Borrower shall prepay on demand
      the outstanding principal amount of any such affected LIBOR Loans, together
      with
      all interest accrued thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate
      applicable to such Loan;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      subject
      to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then
      elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected LIBOR Loans from Lender
      by
      means of Base Rate Loans from Lender. 

Section
      9.2        Unavailability
      of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or Inadequacy of, LIBOR..
   If
      on or
      prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Borrowing of LIBOR
      Loans: 

(a)      the
      Lender determines that deposits in U.S. Dollars (in the applicable amounts)
      are
      not being offered to major banks in the LIBOR interbank market for such Interest
      Period, or that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank LIBOR market
      adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable
      LIBOR, or 

(b)      Lender
      reasonably determines that LIBOR as reasonably determined by the Lender will
      not
      adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lender of funding its LIBOR Loans
      or
      Loan for such Interest Period, then the Lender shall forthwith give notice
      thereof to the Borrower, whereupon until the Lender notifies the Borrower that
      the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
      obligations of the Lender to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. 

Section
      9.3        Increased
      Cost and Reduced Return.     Section
      9.4    
      If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
      regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
      administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
      agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
      by Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or
      not
      having the force of law but, if not having the force of law, compliance with
      which is customary in the relevant jurisdiction) of any such authority, central
      bank or comparable agency: 

22 

i      shall
      subject Lender (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with
      respect to its LIBOR Loans, its Notes   or
      its
      participation in any thereof or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or
      to
      participate therein,   or
      shall
      change the basis of taxation of payments to Lender (or its Lending Office)
      of
      the principal of or interest on its LIBOR Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, or
      participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect
      of its LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make LIBOR Loans, (except for changes
      in
      the rate of tax on the overall net income or profits of Lender or its Lending
      Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which Lender or its lending office is
      incorporated in which Lender s principal executive office or Lending Office is
      located); or 

ii      shall
      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
      requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by
      the
      Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect
      to
      any LIBOR Loans any such requirement included in an applicable LIBOR Reserve
      Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
      extended by, Lender (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on Lender (or its
      Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its
      LIBOR Loans, its Note,   or
      its
      obligation to make Eurodollar Loans  ; 

and
      the
      result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender (or its Lending
      Office) of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan, or to reduce the amount of
      any
      sum received or receivable by Lender (or its Lending Office) under this
      Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by Lender
      to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, the
      Borrower shall be obligated to pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts
      as will compensate Lender for such increased cost or reduction. In the event
      any
      law, rule, regulation or interpretation described above is revoked, declared
      invalid or inapplicable or is otherwise rescinded, and as a result thereof
      Lender is determined to be entitled to a refund from the applicable authority
      for any amount or amounts which were paid or reimbursed by Borrower to Lender
      hereunder, Lender shall refund such amount or amounts to Borrower without
      interest. 

(b)      If,
      after
      the date hereof, Lender shall have determined that the adoption of any
      applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change
      therein (including, without limitation, any revision in the Final Risk-Based
      Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
      (12
      CFR Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A) or of the Office of
      the
      Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A), or in any other
      applicable capital rules heretofore adopted and issued by any governmental
      authority), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
      any
      governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
      interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Lender (or its
      Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
      (whether or not having the force of law but, if not having the force of law,
      compliance with which is customary in  

23 

the
      applicable jurisdiction) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
      agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on Lender s
      capital, or on the capital of any corporation controlling Lender, as a
      consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Lender
      could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into
      consideration Lender s policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
      deemed by Lender to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15)
      days after demand by Lender, the Borrower shall pay to Lender such additional
      amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such reduction. 

(c)      If
      Lender
      determines to seek compensation under this Section 9.3, it shall notify the
      Borrower of the circumstances that entitle it to such compensation pursuant
      to
      this Section 9.3 and will designate a different Lending Office if such
      designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
      and will not, in the sole judgment of Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous
      to
      Lender. A certificate of Lender claiming compensation under this Section 9.3
      and
      setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall
      be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount,
      Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Lender shall
      not be entitled to demand compensation under this Section 9.3 for any period
      more than 90 days prior to the day on which such demand is made;    provided
      however   ,
      that
      the foregoing shall in no way limit the right of Lender to demand or receive
      such compensation to the extent that such compensation relates to the
      retroactive application of any law, regulation, guideline or request if such
      demand is made within 90 days after the implementation of such retroactive
      law,
      interpretation, guideline or request. A certificate as to the nature and amount
      of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Lender in good faith,
      shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
      error. 

Section
      9.5        Lending
      Offices.    The
      Lender may, at its option, elect to make Loans hereunder at the branch, office
      or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof or in the
      assignment agreement which any assignee bank executes pursuant to Section 11.12
      hereof (each a  Lending Office ) for each type of Loan available hereunder or at
      such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time
      elect and designate in a written notice to the Borrower. 

Section
      9.6        Discretion
      of Lender as to Manner of Funding.    Notwithstanding
      any other provision of this Agreement, the Lender shall be entitled to fund
      and
      maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees
      fit,
      it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all
      determinations hereunder shall be made as if the Lender had actually funded
      and
      maintained each LIBOR Loan through the purchase of deposits in the LIBOR
      interbank market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan s Interest Period
      and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest
      Period. 

SECTION
      10.      RESERVED. 

SECTION
      11.      MISCELLANEOUS. 

Section
      11.1        Withholding
      Taxes.    Subject
      to this Section 11.1, each payment by the Borrower under this Agreement or
      the
      other Credit Documents shall be made without withholding for or on account
      of
      any present or future taxes (other than overall net income taxes on the
      recipient). If any such withholding is so required, the Borrower shall make
      the
      withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority
      before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and forthwith pay
      such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount
      actually received by the Lender free and clear of such taxes (including such
      taxes on such additional  

24 

amount)
      is equal to the amount which the Lender would have received had such withholding
      not been made. If the Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes,
      penalties or interest the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for that payment
      on demand. If the Borrower pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall
      deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies
      thereof to the Lender on or before the thirtieth day after payment. If the
      Lender determines it has received or been granted a credit against or relief
      or
      remission for, or repayment of, any taxes paid or payable by it because of
      any
      taxes, penalties or interest paid by the Borrower and evidenced by such a tax
      receipt, Lender shall, to the extent it can do so without prejudice to the
      retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay
      to
      the Borrower such amount as Lender determines is attributable to such deduction
      or withholding and which will leave Lender (after such payment) in no better
      or
      worse position than it would have been in if the Borrower had not been required
      to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing in this Agreement shall interfere
      with the right of the Lender to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner
      it
      thinks fit nor oblige the Lender to disclose any information relating to its
      tax
      affairs or any computations in connection with such taxes. 

Section
      11.2        No
      Waiver of Rights.    No
      delay
      or failure on the part of the Lender or on the part of the holder or holders
      of
      the Note in the exercise of any power or right under any Credit Document shall
      operate as a waiver thereof, nor as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall
      any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
      of
      any other power or right, and the rights and remedies hereunder of the Lender
      and/or the holder or holders of the Note are cumulative to, and not exclusive
      of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have. 

Section
      11.3        Non-Business
      Day.    If
      any
      payment of principal or interest on any Loan or of any other Obligation shall
      fall due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest or fees (as applicable)
      at the rate, if any, such Loan or other Obligation bears for the period prior
      to
      maturity shall continue to accrue on such Obligation from the stated due date
      thereof to and including the next succeeding Business Day, on which the same
      shall be payable. 

Section
      11.4        Documentary
      Taxes.    The
      Borrower agrees that it will pay any documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable
      in respect to any Credit Document, including interest and penalties, in the
      event any such taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is
      made
      and whether or not any credit is then in use or available
      hereunder. 

Section
      11.5        Survival
      of Representations.    All

      representations and warranties made herein or in certificates given pursuant
      hereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other
      Credit Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect with respect
      to
      the date as of which they were made as long as any credit is in use or available
      hereunder. 

Section
      11.6        Survival
      of Indemnities.    All
      indemnities and all other provisions relative to reimbursement to the Lender
      of
      amounts sufficient to protect the yield of the Lender with respect to the Loans,
      including, but not limited to, Section 2.11, Section 9.3 and Section 11.15
      hereof, shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the other Credit
      Documents and the payment of the Loans and all other Obligations. 

25 

Section
      11.7        Set-Off.
          In
      addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not
      by
      way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of
      Default, Lender and each subsequent holder of the Note is hereby authorized
      by
      the Borrower at any time or from time to time, without notice to the Borrower
      or
      to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set
      off
      and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special,
      including, but not limited to, Indebtedness evidenced by certificates of
      deposit, whether matured or unmatured, and in whatever currency denominated)
      and
      any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Lender or that
      subsequent holder to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower, whether
      or not matured, against and on account of the obligations and liabilities of
      the
      Borrower to the Lender or that subsequent holder under the Credit Documents,
      including, but not limited to, all claims of any nature or description arising
      out of or connected with the Credit Documents, irrespective of whether or not
      (a) the Lender or that subsequent holder shall have made any demand hereunder
      or
      (b) the principal of or the interest on the Loans or the Note and other amounts
      due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 8 and
      although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent
      or
      unmatured. 

Section
      11.8        Notices. 
         Except
      as
      otherwise specified herein, all notices under the Credit Documents shall be
      in
      writing (including facsimile or other electronic communication) and shall be
      given to a party hereunder at its address or facsimile number set forth below
      or
      such other address or facsimile number as such party may hereafter specify
      by
      notice to the Lender and the Borrower, given by courier, by United States
      certified or registered mail, or by other telecommunication device capable
      of
      creating a written record of such notice and its receipt. Notices under the
      Credit Documents to the Lender and the Borrower shall be addressed
      to: 

26 

Each
        such

(a)       Successors
        and Assigns Generally    The
        provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
        of
        the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted
        hereby,
        except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its
        rights
        or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender
        and
        Lender may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
        hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the

        attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).
        Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
        upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors
        and

        Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees its rights
        and
        obligations under this Agreement (including its Revolving Credit Commitment
        and
        the Loans at the time owing to it);    provided   
        that so
        long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any assignment
        of a
        Revolving Credit Commitment must be approved by the Borrower, which approval

        Agreement, Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to
        be
        entitled to the benefits of Sections 9.3 and 11.1 with respect to facts and
        circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any
        assignment or transfer by Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
        that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of

        Agreement as a sale by Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
        in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section. 

(e)        Participations.
           Lender
        and/or any holder of the Note may at any time, without the consent of, or

        person
        or a Borrower or any of the Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
    Participant    )
        in all
        or a portion of Lender s or such holder s rights and/or obligations under this
        Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment
        and/or
        the Loans owing to it);    provided   
        that
        (i) Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
        (ii) Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
        the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower shall continue
        to deal solely and directly with Lender in connection with Lender s rights and
        obligations under this Agreement.

Any
          agreement or instrument pursuant to which Lender sells such a participation
          shall provide that Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement
          and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
          this
          Agreement;    provided   
          that
          such agreement or instrument may provide that Lender will not, without
          the
          consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
          of
          the type described in Section 11.13(i) that directly affects such Participant.
          Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
          Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.11, Section
          9.3 and
          Section 11.7 to the same extent as if it were Lender and had acquired its
          interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. Lender
          shall keep a register, meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulation
          Section
          5f.103-1(c), of each participant, specifying such participant s entitlement to
          payments of principal and interest with respect to such
          participation. 

(f)       Limitations
      upon Participant Rights.     A
      Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
      2.11, Section 9.3 or Section 11.7 than the Lender would have been entitled
      to
      receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
      the
      sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior
      written consent . 

(g)        Certain
      Pledges.     The
      Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
      portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of the Lender,
      including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
      to a
      Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release
      Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
      or
      assignee for Lender as a party hereto .     Certain
      Funding Arrangements.      Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained herein, Lender may grant to a special purpose
      funding vehicle (a     SPC    ),
      identified as such in writing from time to time by the Lender and the Borrower,
      the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that the
      Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this
      Agreement;    provided   
      that (i)
      nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
      if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
      all
      or any part of such Loan, the Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
      pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
      utilize the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Lender to the same extent, and
      as
      if, such Loan were made by the Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that
      no
      SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
      Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Lender). In furtherance
      of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive
      the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year
      and
      one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other
      senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or join any
      other
      person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization,
      arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United
      States or any State thereof arising out of any claim relating to the Credit
      Documents. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
      in
      this Section 11.12(b), any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior
      written consent of, the Borrower, assign all or a portion of its interests
      in
      any Loan to the Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the
      Borrower and Lender) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
      account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii)
      disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
      Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
      guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This section may
      not
      be amended without the written consent of the SPC   .

      liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable expenses

      or

      LIBOR Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrower agrees that
      the Lender may rely on any such telephonic or facsimile notice given by any
      person it in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative without the
      necessity of independent investigation, and in the event any such notice by
      telephone conflicts with any written confirmation, such telephonic notice shall
      govern if the Lender has acted in reliance thereon. There may be no more than
      five different Interest Periods in effect at any one time, provided that for
      purposes of determining the number of Interest Periods in effect at any one
      time, all Base Rate Loans shall be deemed to have one and the same Interest
      Period. 

(a)       [Reserved]   
      . 

(b)       Borrower s
      Failure to Notify   .
      Any
      outstanding Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall, subject to Section 6.2 hereof,
      automatically be continued for an additional Interest Period on the last day
      of
      its then current Interest Period as a Base Rate Loan unless the Borrower has
      notified the Lender within the period required by Section 2.5(a) that it intends
      to convert such Borrowing into a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans or notifies the Lender
      within the period required by Section 2.8(a) that it intends to prepay such
      Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5(a)
      above
      of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans before the last day of its then current Interest Period
      within the period required by Section 2.5(a) and has not notified the Lender
      within the period required by Section 2.8(a) that it intends to prepay such
      Borrowing, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing
      of
      Base Rate Loans, subject to Section 6.2 hereof.  

Section
      2.8        Interest
      Periods   .
       As provided in Section 2.5(a) hereof, at the time of each request to
      advance, continue, or create by conversion a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the
      Borrower shall select an Interest Period applicable to such Loans from among
      the
      available options. The term     Interest
      Period    
means
      the period commencing on the date a Borrowing of Loans is advanced, continued,
      or created by conversion and ending: (a) in the case of Base Rate Loans, on
      the
      last Business Day of the calendar quarter in which such Borrowing is advanced,
      continued, or created by conversion (or on the last day of the following
      calendar quarter if such Loan is advanced, continued or created by conversion
      on
      the last Business Day of a calendar quarter), and (b) in the case of LIBOR
      Loans, 1, 2 or 3 months thereafter;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      that: 

(a)      any
      Interest Period for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans that otherwise would end
      after the Termination Date shall end on the Termination Date;  

10 

(b)      for
      any
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower may not select an Interest Period that
      extends beyond the Termination Date; 

(c)      whenever
      the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be a day that is not a
      Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall be extended to the
      next
      succeeding Business Day, provided that, if such extension would cause the last
      day of an Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans to occur in the
      following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall be the
      immediately preceding Business Day; and 

(d)      for
      purposes of determining an Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans,
      a
      month means a period starting on one day in a calendar month and ending on
      the
      numerically corresponding day in the next calendar month;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      that if
      there is no numerically corresponding day in the month in which such an Interest
      Period is to end or if such an Interest Period begins on the last Business
      Day
      of a calendar month, then such Interest Period shall end on the last Business
      Day of the calendar month in which such Interest Period is to end.

      2.9        Maturity
      of Loans   .

      acceleration or otherwise), each Loan shall mature and become due and payable
      by
      the Borrower on the Termination Date.

      not
      less than $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof,
      (ii)
      if such Borrowing is of LIBOR Loans, in an amount not less than $2,000,000
      and
      integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) in an amount such
      that the minimum amount required for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof

      prepayment. In the case of LIBOR Loans, any amounts owing under Section 2.11
      hereof as a result of such prepayment shall be paid contemporaneously with
      such
      prepayment. Any amount paid or prepaid before the Termination Date may, subject
      to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, be borrowed, repaid and borrowed
      again. 

(a)      At
      any
      time that the Borrower becomes aware, or should have become aware (pursuant
      to
      Borrower s ordinary business practices) that the aggregate amount of outstanding
      Loans shall at any time for any reason exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment
      then in effect, the Borrower shall, immediately notify the Lender of this
      determination. Within two (2) Business Days of the delivery of the notice
      described in the preceding sentence, the Borrower shall, without further notice
      or demand, pay the amount of such excess to the Lender as a prepayment of the
      Loans. Each such prepayment shall be accompanied by a payment of all accrued
      and
      unpaid interest on the Loans prepaid and shall be subject to Section
      2.11. 

Section
      2.12        Default
      Rate   .
       If any payment of principal on any Loan or other Obligation is not made
      when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), such Loan shall bear interest
      (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed or, if

      the
      basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and the actual number of

      (2%) plus the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect;
      and 

(b)      for
      any
      LIBOR Loan, the sum of two percent (2%) plus the rate of interest in effect
      thereon at the time of such default until the end of the Interest Period
      applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of
      two

      or to be made by, Lender under the Credit Documents, the Borrower shall promptly
      execute and deliver to Lender a promissory note in the form of Exhibit A hereto

      by Lender to fund or maintain any LIBOR Loan or the relending or reinvesting
      of
      such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to Lender) as a result of: 

(a)      any
      payment (whether by acceleration or otherwise), prepayment or conversion of
      a
      LIBOR Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest
      Period, 

(b)      any
      failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Section 6 or otherwise)
      by the Borrower to borrow or continue a LIBOR Loan, or to convert a Base Rate
      Loan into a LIBOR Loan, on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to
      Section 2.5(a) or established pursuant to Section 2.5(c) hereof, 

(c)      any
      failure by the Borrower to make any payment of principal on any LIBOR Loan
      when
      due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or 

(d)      any
      acceleration of the maturity of a LIBOR Loan as a result of the occurrence
      of
      any Event of Default hereunder, 

then,
      upon the demand of Lender, the Borrower shall pay to Lender such amount as
      will
      reimburse Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If Lender makes such a claim
      for compensation, it shall provide to the Borrower a certificate executed by
      an
      officer of Lender setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in
      reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation
      of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate if
      reasonably calculated shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

      any
      partial termination to be in an amount not less than $2,000,000 and integral
      multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof,    provided   
      that the
      Revolving Credit Commitment may not be reduced to an amount less than the sum
      of
      the amount of all Loans then outstanding. Any termination of Revolving Credit

      LIBOR rate (or other base rate determined pursuant to Section 2.9(b)) divided
      by
      (B) one minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage over (ii) the rate specified in
      clause (i)(A). Any computation by Lender of such additional interest shall

      payable hereunder in respect of such Loan is less than the rate (as determined
      by the Lender in consultation with the Borrower) at which funds of comparable
      term and amount are generally available to the Borrower in the commercial paper
      market (the     CP
      Rate    )

    Arbitrage
      Condition    ),
      the
      Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender arbitrage compensation on such Loan at
      a
      rate equal to the difference between the effective interest rate payable
      hereunder (inclusive of all fees) in respect of such Loan and the CP Rate as
      applied to such Loan. Such payments shall continue, at the time and in the
      manner set forth for payments of interest on such Loan, for as long as the
      Arbitrage Condition continues. Upon the termination of the Arbitrage Condition
      for any reason (as determined by the Lender in consultation with the Borrower),
      such payments shall no longer be due with respect to such Loan, even if a future
      Arbitrage Condition were to occur prior to repayment in full of such
      Loan.

SECTION
      5.      REPRESENTATIONS
      AND WARRANTIES. 

The
      Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Lender as to itself and, where
      the following representations and warranties apply to Subsidiaries, as to each
      of its Subsidiaries, as follows: 

14 

Section
      5.1        Corporate
      Organization and Authority   .
       The Borrower is duly organized and existing in good standing under the
      laws of the State of Illinois; has all necessary corporate power to carry on
      its
      present business; and is duly licensed or qualified and, in good standing in
      each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
      standing would have a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section
      5.2        Corporate
      Authority and Validity of Obligations   .
       The Borrower has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and
      the other Credit Documents to which it is a party, to make the borrowings herein
      provided for, to issue its Notes in evidence thereof, and to perform all of
      its
      obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party. Each Credit
      Document to which it is a party has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
      by the Borrower and constitutes valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
      enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
      be
      limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
      affecting the enforceability of creditors  rights generally and by equitable
      principles of general applicability (regardless of whether such enforceability
      is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). No Credit Document, nor
      the
      performance or observance by the Borrower of any of the matters or things
      therein provided for, contravenes any provision of law or any charter or by-law
      provision of the Borrower or any material Contractual Obligation of or affecting
      the Borrower or any of its Properties or results in or requires the creation
      or

      historical performance of the Borrower for each of the Borrower s fiscal
      quarters and/or years ending on or before June 30, 2006, have been prepared
      in
      accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis
      consistent, except as otherwise noted therein, with that of the previous fiscal
      year. Each of such financial statements fairly presents on a consolidated basis
      the financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
      thereof and the results of operations for the periods covered thereby. The
      Borrower and its Subsidiaries have no material contingent liabilities other
      than
      those disclosed in the financial statements or in comments or footnotes thereto,
      or in any report supplementary thereto, most recently furnished to the Lender
      as
      of the time such representation and warranty is made, including reports of
      the
      Borrower filed with the SEC from time to time. Since June 30, 2006 through
      the

      in a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section
      5.4        Approvals   .
       No authorization, approval, consent, license, exemption, filing or
      registration with any court or governmental department, agency or
      instrumentality, nor any approval or consent of the stockholders of the Borrower
      or any Subsidiary or from any other Person, is necessary to the valid execution,
      delivery or performance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Credit Document
      to which it is a party. 

Section
      5.5        ERISA   .

      Controlled Group has fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding
      standards of and is in compliance in all material respects with the Employee
      Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (    ERISA    ),
      and
      with the Code to the extent applicable to it and has not incurred any liability
      to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (    PBGC    )
      or a
      Plan under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums
      under Section 4007 of ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any
      contingent liabilities for any post-retirement benefits under a Welfare Plan,
      other than liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of Title
      I of

      in a

      Loan for such Interest Period, then the Lender shall forthwith give notice
      thereof to the Borrower, whereupon until the Lender notifies the Borrower that
      the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
      obligations of the Lender to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended.

      9.4  
      If, on
      or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
      regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
      administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
      agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
      by Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or
      not
      having the force of law but, if not having the force of law, compliance with
      which is customary in the relevant jurisdiction) of any such authority, central
      bank or comparable agency: 

22 

i      shall
      subject Lender (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with
      respect to its LIBOR Loans, its Notes   or
      its
      participation in any thereof or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or
      to
      participate therein,   or
      shall
      change the basis of taxation of payments to Lender (or its Lending Office)
      of
      the principal of or interest on its LIBOR Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, or
      participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect
      of its LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make LIBOR Loans, (except for changes
      in
      the rate of tax on the overall net income or profits of Lender or its Lending
      Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which Lender or its lending office is
      incorporated in which Lender s principal executive office or Lending Office is
      located); or 

ii      shall
      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
      requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by
      the
      Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect
      to
      any LIBOR Loans any such requirement included in an applicable LIBOR Reserve
      Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
      extended by, Lender (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on Lender (or its
      Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its
      LIBOR Loans, its Note,   or
      its
      obligation to make Eurodollar Loans  ; 

and
      the
      result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender (or its Lending
      Office) of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan, or to reduce the amount of
      any
      sum received or receivable by Lender (or its Lending Office) under this
      Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by Lender
      to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, the
      Borrower shall be obligated to pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts
      as will compensate Lender for such increased cost or reduction. In the event
      any
      law, rule, regulation or interpretation described above is revoked, declared
      invalid or inapplicable or is otherwise rescinded, and as a result thereof
      Lender is determined to be entitled to a refund from the applicable authority
      for any amount or amounts which were paid or reimbursed by Borrower to Lender
      hereunder, Lender shall refund such amount or amounts to Borrower without
      interest. 

(b)      If,
      after
      the date hereof, Lender shall have determined that the adoption of any
      applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change
      therein (including, without limitation, any revision in the Final Risk-Based
      Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
      (12
      CFR Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A) or of the Office of
      the
      Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A), or in any other
      applicable capital rules heretofore adopted and issued by any governmental
      authority), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
      any
      governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
      interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Lender (or its
      Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
      (whether or not having the force of law but, if not having the force of law,
      compliance with which is customary in the applicable jurisdiction) of any such
      authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect
      of
      reducing the rate of return on Lender s capital, or on the capital of any
      corporation controlling Lender, as a consequence of its obligations hereunder
      to
      a level below that which Lender could have achieved but for such adoption,
      change or compliance (taking into consideration Lender s policies with respect
      to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Lender to be material, then from
      time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, the Borrower
      shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender
      for such reduction. 

23 

(c)      If
      Lender
      determines to seek compensation under this Section 9.3, it shall notify the
      Borrower of the circumstances that entitle it to such compensation pursuant
      to
      this Section 9.3 and will designate a different Lending Office if such
      designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
      and will not, in the sole judgment of Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous
      to
      Lender. A certificate of Lender claiming compensation under this Section 9.3
      and
      setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall
      be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount,
      Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Lender shall
      not be entitled to demand compensation under this Section 9.3 for any period
      more than 90 days prior to the day on which such demand is made;    provided
      however   ,
      that
      the foregoing shall in no way limit the right of Lender to demand or receive
      such compensation to the extent that such compensation relates to the
      retroactive application of any law, regulation, guideline or request if such
      demand is made within 90 days after the implementation of such retroactive
      law,
      interpretation, guideline or request. A certificate as to the nature and amount
      of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Lender in good faith,
      shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
      error. 

Section
      9.5        Lending
      Offices   .
       The Lender may, at its option, elect to make Loans hereunder at the
      branch, office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof
      or in the assignment agreement which any assignee bank executes pursuant to
      Section 11.12 hereof (each a  Lending Office ) for each type of Loan available
      hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may
      from
      time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the
      Borrower. 

Section
      9.6        Discretion
      of Lender as to Manner of Funding   .
       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Lender shall be
      entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in
      any
      manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of
      this
      Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if the Lender had
      actually funded and maintained each LIBOR Loan through the purchase of deposits
      in the LIBOR interbank market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan s
      Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest
      Period. 

SECTION
      10.      RESERVED. 

SECTION
      11.      MISCELLANEOUS. 

Section
      11.1        Withholding
      Taxes   .
       Subject to this Section 11.1, each payment by the Borrower under this
      Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall be made without withholding for
      or
      on account of any present or future taxes (other than overall net income taxes
      on the recipient). If any such withholding is so required, the Borrower shall
      make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental
      authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and
      forthwith pay such additional amount as may be  

24 

necessary
      to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Lender free and clear
      of
      such taxes (including such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the
      amount which the Lender would have received had such withholding not been made.
      If the Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or
      interest the Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for that payment on demand.
      If
      the Borrower pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver
      official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to
      the
      Lender on or before the thirtieth day after payment. If the Lender determines
      it
      has received or been granted a credit against or relief or remission for, or
      repayment of, any taxes paid or payable by it because of any taxes, penalties
      or
      interest paid by the Borrower and evidenced by such a tax receipt, Lender shall,
      to the extent it can do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount
      of
      such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower such amount
      as
      Lender determines is attributable to such deduction or withholding and which
      will leave Lender (after such payment) in no better or worse position than
      it
      would have been in if the Borrower had not been required to make such deduction
      or withholding. Nothing in this Agreement shall interfere with the right of
      the
      Lender to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige
      the Lender to disclose any information relating to its tax affairs or any
      computations in connection with such taxes. 

Section
      11.2        No
      Waiver of Rights   .
       No delay or failure on the part of the Lender or on the part of the holder
      or holders of the Note in the exercise of any power or right under any Credit
      Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor as an acquiescence in any
      default, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
      or
      further exercise of any other power or right, and the rights and remedies
      hereunder of the Lender and/or the holder or holders of the Note are cumulative
      to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would
      otherwise have. 

Section
      11.3        Non-Business
      Day   . 
      If any payment of principal or interest on any Loan or of any other Obligation
      shall fall due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest or fees (as
      applicable) at the rate, if any, such Loan or other Obligation bears for the
      period prior to maturity shall continue to accrue on such Obligation from the
      stated due date thereof to and including the next succeeding Business Day,
      on
      which the same shall be payable. 

Section
      11.4        Documentary
      Taxes   .
       The Borrower agrees that it will pay any documentary, stamp or similar
      taxes payable in respect to any Credit Document, including interest and
      penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such
      assessment is made and whether or not any credit is then in use or available
      hereunder. 

Section
      11.5        Survival
      of Representations   .
       All representations and warranties made herein or in certificates given
      pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement
      and
      the other Credit Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect with
      respect to the date as of which they were made as long as any credit is in
      use
      or available hereunder. 

Section
      11.6        Survival
      of Indemnities   .
       All indemnities and all other provisions relative to reimbursement to the
      Lender of amounts sufficient to protect the yield of the Lender with respect
      to
      the Loans, including, but not limited to, Section 2.11, Section 9.3 and Section
      11.15 hereof, shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the other
      Credit Documents and the payment of the Loans and all other
      Obligations.

      certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, and in whatever currency
      denominated) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by the Lender
      or that subsequent holder to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower,
      whether or not matured, against and on account of the obligations and
      liabilities of the Borrower to the Lender or that subsequent holder under the
      Credit Documents, including, but not limited to, all claims of any nature or
      description arising out of or connected with the Credit Documents, irrespective
      of whether or not (a) the Lender or that subsequent holder shall have made
      any
      demand hereunder or (b) the principal of or the interest on the Loans or the
      Note and other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant
      to Section 8 and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them,
      may
      be contingent or unmatured. 

Section
      11.8        Notices   .
       Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices under the Credit
      Documents shall be in writing (including facsimile or other electronic
      communication) and shall be given to a party hereunder at its address or
      facsimile number set forth below or such other address or facsimile number
      as
      such party may hereafter specify by notice to the Lender and the Borrower,
      given

      telecommunication device capable of creating a written record of such notice
      and
      its receipt. Notices under the Credit Documents to the Lender and the Borrower

(a)       Successors
      and Assigns Generally     The
      provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
      of
      the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
      except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
      or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Lender and
      Lender may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
      hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance with the
      provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of
      participation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this
      Section or (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest
      subject to the restrictions of paragraph (f) of this Section (and any other
      attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void).
      Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
      upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors
      and
      assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in
      paragraph (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated
      hereby, the affiliates of each of the Lender and the Lender) any legal or
      equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

27 

(b)       Assignments
      by Lender.    The
      Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible Assignees its rights
      and
      obligations under this Agreement (including its Revolving Credit Commitment
      and
      the Loans at the time owing to it);    provided   
      that so
      long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any assignment
      of a
      Revolving Credit Commitment must be approved by the Borrower, which approval
      shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless the Person that is the proposed
      assignee is itself an Eligible Assignee. Subject to acceptance and recording
      thereof by the Lender pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, from and
      after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the
      Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the
      extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
      rights and obligations of Lender under this Agreement shall to the extent of
      the
      interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
      obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
      Assumption covering all of the Lender s rights and obligations under this
      Agreement, Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be
      entitled to the benefits of Sections 9.3 and 11.1 with respect to facts and
      circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any
      assignment or transfer by Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
      that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
      Agreement as a sale by Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
      in accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section. 

(c)        Participations.
         Lender
      and/or any holder of the Note may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
      to, the Borrower, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person
      or a Borrower or any of the Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
    Participant    )
      in all
      or a portion of Lender s or such holder s rights and/or obligations under this
      Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or
      the Loans owing to it);    provided   
      that
      (i) Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,
      (ii) Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
      the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower shall continue
      to deal solely and directly with Lender in connection with Lender s rights and
      obligations under this Agreement.   Any
      agreement or instrument pursuant to which Lender sells such a participation
      shall provide that Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement
      and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
      Agreement;    provided   
      that
      such agreement or instrument may provide that Lender will not, without the
      consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
      of
      the type described in Section 11.13(i) that directly affects such Participant.
      Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
      Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.11, Section 9.3
      and
      Section 11.7 to the same extent as if it were Lender and had acquired its
      interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. Lender
      shall keep a register, meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
      5f.103-1(c), of each participant, specifying such participant s entitlement to
      payments of principal and interest with respect to such
      participation. 

28 

(d)       Limitations
      upon Participant Rights.    A
      Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
      2.11, Section 9.3 or Section 11.7 than the Lender would have been entitled
      to
      receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
      the
      sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior
      written consent. 

(e)        Certain
      Pledges.    The
      Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
      portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of the Lender,
      including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
      to a
      Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release
      Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
      or
      assignee for Lender as a party hereto.       Certain
      Funding Arrangements.    Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained herein, Lender may grant to a special purpose
      funding vehicle (a     SPC    ),
      identified as such in writing from time to time by the Lender and the Borrower,
      the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that the
      Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this
      Agreement;    provided   
      that (i)
      nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
      if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
      all
      or any part of such Loan, the Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
      pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
      utilize the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Lender to the same extent, and
      as
      if, such Loan were made by the Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that
      no
      SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
      Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Lender). In furtherance

      at
      least one (1) Business Day before the date on which the Borrower requests the
      Lender to advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. The Loans included in each
      Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such
      notice of a new Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time elect
      to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or,
      subject to Section 2.4 s minimum amount requirement for each outstanding
      Borrowing, a portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of LIBOR
      Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower
      may continue part or all of such Borrowing as LIBOR Loans for an Interest Period
      or Interest Periods specified by the Borrower or convert part or all of such
      Borrowing into Base Rate Loans, (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans,
      on
      any Business Day, the Borrower may convert all or part of such Borrowing into
      LIBOR Loans for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the
      Borrower. The Borrower shall give all such notices requesting the advance,
      continuation, or conversion of a Borrowing to the Lender by telephone or
      facsimile (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone,
      shall be promptly confirmed in writing). Notices of the continuation of a
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion
      of part or all of a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans or of Base
      Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans must be given by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago
      time) at least three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested
      continuation or conversion. All such notices concerning the advance,
      continuation, or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the
      requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be
      a

9 

Business
      Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued, or
      converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted
      Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of LIBOR Loans, the Interest
      Period applicable thereto. The Borrower agrees that the Lender may rely on
      any
      such telephonic or facsimile notice given by any person it in good faith
      believes is an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent
      investigation, and in the event any such notice by telephone conflicts with
      any
      written confirmation, such telephonic notice shall govern if the Lender has
      acted in reliance thereon. There may be no more than five different Interest
      Periods in effect at any one time, provided that for purposes of determining
      the
      number of Interest Periods in effect at any one time, all Base Rate Loans shall
      be deemed to have one and the same Interest Period.

(b)       Borrower s
      Failure to Notify   .

      its then current Interest Period as a Base Rate Loan unless the Borrower has
      notified the Lender within the period required by Section 2.5(a) that it intends
      to convert such Borrowing into a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans or notifies the Lender
      within the period required by Section 2.8(a) that it intends to prepay such
      Borrowing. If the Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 2.5(a)
      above
      of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans before the last day of its then current Interest Period
      within the period required by Section 2.5(a) and has not notified the Lender
      within the period required by Section 2.8(a) that it intends to prepay such
      Borrowing, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing
      of

      or created by conversion and ending: (a) in the case of Base Rate Loans, on
      the
      last Business Day of the calendar quarter in which such Borrowing is advanced,

      the last Business Day of a calendar quarter), and (b) in the case of LIBOR
      Loans, 1, 2 or 3 months thereafter;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      that:

      Interest Period for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans that otherwise would end
      after the Termination Date shall end on the Termination Date;  

(b)      for
      any
      Borrowing of LIBOR Loans, the Borrower may not select an Interest Period that
      extends beyond the Termination Date; 

(c)      whenever
      the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be a day that is not a
      Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall be extended to the
      next
      succeeding Business Day, provided that, if such extension would cause the last
      day of an Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans to occur in the
      following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall be the
      immediately preceding Business Day; and

      purposes of determining an Interest Period for a Borrowing of LIBOR Loans,
      a
      month means a period starting on one day in a calendar month and ending on
      the
      numerically corresponding day in the next calendar month;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      that if
      there is no numerically corresponding day in the month in which such an Interest
      Period is to end or if such an Interest Period begins on the last Business
      Day
      of a calendar month, then such Interest Period shall end on the last Business
      Day of the calendar month in which such Interest Period is to end.

      not
      less than $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $500,000 in excess thereof,

      hereof as a result of such prepayment shall be paid contemporaneously with
      such
      prepayment. Any amount paid or prepaid before the Termination Date may, subject

      Loans shall at any time for any reason exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment
      then in effect, the Borrower shall, immediately notify the Lender of this
      determination. Within two (2) Business Days of the delivery of the notice
      described in the preceding sentence, the Borrower shall, without further notice
      or demand, pay the amount of such excess to the Lender as a prepayment of the
      Loans. Each such prepayment shall be accompanied by a payment of all accrued

      unpaid interest on the Loans prepaid and shall be subject to Section
      2.11.

(d)      any
      acceleration of the maturity of a LIBOR Loan as a result of the occurrence
      of
      any Event of Default hereunder, 

then,
      upon the demand of Lender, the Borrower shall pay to Lender such amount as
      will
      reimburse Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If Lender makes such a claim

      by
      (B) one minus the LIBOR Reserve Percentage over (ii) the rate specified in
      clause (i)(A). Any computation by Lender of such additional interest shall

      additional interest (x) it shall notify the Borrower that it is subject to
      LIBOR
      reserves under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve

      and
      amount are generally available to the Borrower in the commercial paper market
      (the     CP
      Rate    )

    Arbitrage
      Condition    ),
      the
      Borrower agrees to pay to the Lender arbitrage compensation on such Loan at
      a

      hereunder (inclusive of all fees) in respect of such Loan and the CP Rate as
      applied to such Loan. Such payments shall continue, at the time and in the
      manner set forth for payments of interest on such Loan, for as long as the
      Arbitrage Condition continues. Upon the termination of the Arbitrage Condition
      for any reason (as determined by the Lender in consultation with the Borrower),

SECTION
      5.      REPRESENTATIONS
      AND WARRANTIES. 

The
      Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Lender as to itself and, where
      the following representations and warranties apply to Subsidiaries, as to each
      of its Subsidiaries, as follows: 

Section

      Organization and Authority   . 
      The Borrower is duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws
      of
      the State of Illinois; has all necessary corporate power to carry on its present

      jurisdiction in which the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good
      standing would have a Material Adverse Effect. 

Section
      5.2        Corporate
      Authority and Validity of Obligations   .

      provided for, to issue its Notes in evidence thereof, and to perform all of
      its
      obligations under the Credit Documents to which it is a party. Each Credit
      Document to which it is a party has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
      by the Borrower and constitutes valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
      enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
      be
      limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws

14 

affecting
      the enforceability of creditors  rights generally and by equitable principles of
      general applicability (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
      in a proceeding in equity or at law). No Credit Document, nor the performance
      or
      observance by the Borrower of any of the matters or things therein provided
      for,
      contravenes any provision of law or any charter or by-law provision of the
      Borrower or any material Contractual Obligation of or affecting the Borrower

      generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent, except

      condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
      the
      results of operations for the periods covered thereby. The Borrower and its
      Subsidiaries have no material contingent liabilities other than those disclosed
      in the financial statements or in comments or footnotes thereto, or in any
      report supplementary thereto, most recently furnished to the Lender as of the

      with any court or governmental department, agency or instrumentality, nor any

      from any other Person, is necessary to the valid execution, delivery or
      performance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any Credit Document to which
      it
      is a party.

      to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (    PBGC    )
      or a
      Plan under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability to the PBGC for premiums
      under Section 4007 of ERISA. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has any
      contingent liabilities for any post-retirement benefits under a Welfare Plan,
      other than liability for continuation coverage described in Part 6 of Title

      Federal Reserve System). The Borrower will not use the proceeds of any Loan
      in a
      manner that violates any provision of Regulation U or X of the Board of
      Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Borrower is not subject to
      regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, the Borrower
      is not an  investment company  registered or required to be registered under the

      backstop commercial paper issued by the Borrower and for general corporate
      purposes.

      and (b) declare the principal of and the accrued interest on the outstanding
      Note to be forthwith due and payable and thereupon the Note, including both
      principal and interest thereon, and all other Obligations, shall be and become

      Documents without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind and the
      obligation of the Lender to extend further credit pursuant to any of the terms
      hereof shall immediately terminate. 

Section
      8.4        Expenses   .

      all

Section
      9.1        Change
      of Law   . 
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Note, if at any
      time after the date hereof any change in applicable law or regulation or in
      the
      interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for Lender to make or continue to
      maintain LIBOR Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby,
      Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower and Lender s
      obligations to make or maintain LIBOR Loans under this Agreement shall terminate
      until it is no longer unlawful for Lender to make or maintain LIBOR Loans.
      The
      Borrower shall prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such
      affected LIBOR Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon at a rate
      per
      annum equal to the interest rate applicable to such Loan;    provided   ,
         however   ,
      subject
      to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Borrower may then
      elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected LIBOR Loans from Lender
      by
      means of Base Rate Loans from Lender. 

21 

Section
      9.2        Unavailability
      of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or Inadequacy of, LIBOR   .
       If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Borrowing
      of LIBOR Loans: 

(a)      the
      Lender determines that deposits in U.S. Dollars (in the applicable amounts)
      are
      not being offered to major banks in the LIBOR interbank market for such Interest
      Period, or that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank LIBOR market
      adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable
      LIBOR, or 

(b)      Lender
      reasonably determines that LIBOR as reasonably determined by the Lender will
      not
      adequately and fairly reflect the cost to Lender of funding its LIBOR Loans
      or
      Loan for such Interest Period, then the Lender shall forthwith give notice
      thereof to the Borrower, whereupon until the Lender notifies the Borrower that
      the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the
      obligations of the Lender to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. 

Section
      9.3        Increased
      Cost and Reduced Return   .  
        Section
      9.4     
      If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or
      regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
      administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
      agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
      by Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or
      not
      having the force of law but, if not having the force of law, compliance with
      which is customary in the relevant jurisdiction) of any such authority, central
      bank or comparable agency: 

i      shall
      subject Lender (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with
      respect to its LIBOR Loans, its Notes   or
      its
      participation in any thereof or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or
      to
      participate therein,   or
      shall
      change the basis of taxation of payments to Lender (or its Lending Office)
      of
      the principal of or interest on its LIBOR Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, or
      participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement in respect
      of its LIBOR Loans or its obligation to make LIBOR Loans, (except for changes
      in
      the rate of tax on the overall net income or profits of Lender or its Lending
      Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which Lender or its lending office is
      incorporated in which Lender s principal executive office or Lending Office is
      located); or 

ii      shall
      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
      requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by
      the
      Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect
      to
      any LIBOR Loans any such requirement included in an applicable LIBOR Reserve
      Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
      extended by, Lender (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on Lender (or its
      Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its
      LIBOR Loans, its Note,   or
      its
      obligation to make Eurodollar Loans  ; 

and
      the
      result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender (or its Lending
      Office) of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan, or to reduce the amount of
      any
      sum received or receivable by Lender (or its Lending Office) under this
      Agreement or under its Note with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by Lender
      to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, the
      Borrower shall be obligated  

22 

to
      pay to
      Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender for such
      increased cost or reduction. In the event any law, rule, regulation or
      interpretation described above is revoked, declared invalid or inapplicable
      or
      is otherwise rescinded, and as a result thereof Lender is determined to be
      entitled to a refund from the applicable authority for any amount or amounts
      which were paid or reimbursed by Borrower to Lender hereunder, Lender shall
      refund such amount or amounts to Borrower without interest. 

(b)      If,
      after
      the date hereof, Lender shall have determined that the adoption of any
      applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change
      therein (including, without limitation, any revision in the Final Risk-Based
      Capital Guidelines of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
      (12
      CFR Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A) or of the Office of
      the
      Comptroller of the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A), or in any other
      applicable capital rules heretofore adopted and issued by any governmental
      authority), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
      any
      governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
      interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Lender (or its
      Lending Office) with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
      (whether or not having the force of law but, if not having the force of law,
      compliance with which is customary in the applicable jurisdiction) of any such
      authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect
      of
      reducing the rate of return on Lender s capital, or on the capital of any
      corporation controlling Lender, as a consequence of its obligations hereunder
      to
      a level below that which Lender could have achieved but for such adoption,
      change or compliance (taking into consideration Lender s policies with respect
      to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by Lender to be material, then from
      time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by Lender, the Borrower
      shall pay to Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender
      for such reduction. 

(c)      If
      Lender
      determines to seek compensation under this Section 9.3, it shall notify the
      Borrower of the circumstances that entitle it to such compensation pursuant
      to
      this Section 9.3 and will designate a different Lending Office if such
      designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
      and will not, in the sole judgment of Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous
      to
      Lender. A certificate of Lender claiming compensation under this Section 9.3
      and
      setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall
      be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount,
      Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Lender shall
      not be entitled to demand compensation under this Section 9.3 for any period
      more than 90 days prior to the day on which such demand is made;    provided
      however   ,
      that
      the foregoing shall in no way limit the right of Lender to demand or receive
      such compensation to the extent that such compensation relates to the
      retroactive application of any law, regulation, guideline or request if such
      demand is made within 90 days after the implementation of such retroactive
      law,
      interpretation, guideline or request. A certificate as to the nature and amount
      of such increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Lender in good faith,
      shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
      error. 

Section
      9.5        Lending
      Offices   . 
      The Lender may, at its option, elect to make Loans hereunder at the branch,
      office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof or in
      the
      assignment agreement which any assignee bank executes pursuant to Section 11.12
      hereof (each a  Lending Office ) for each type of Loan available hereunder or at
      such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time
      elect and designate in a written notice to the Borrower. 

23 

Section
      9.6        Discretion
      of Lender as to Manner of Funding   . 
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Lender shall be
      entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in
      any
      manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of
      this
      Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if the Lender had
      actually funded and maintained each LIBOR Loan through the purchase of deposits
      in the LIBOR interbank market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan s
      Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest
      Period. 

SECTION
      10.      RESERVED. 

SECTION
      11.      MISCELLANEOUS. 

Section
      11.1        Withholding
      Taxes   . 
      Subject to this Section 11.1, each payment by the Borrower under this Agreement
      or the other Credit Documents shall be made without withholding for or on
      account of any present or future taxes (other than overall net income taxes
      on
      the recipient). If any such withholding is so required, the Borrower shall
      make
      the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental
      authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon and
      forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the
      net
      amount actually received by the Lender free and clear of such taxes (including
      such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount which the Lender
      would have received had such withholding not been made. If the Lender pays
      any
      amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or interest the Borrower shall
      reimburse the Lender for that payment on demand. If the Borrower pays any such
      taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing
      that payment or certified copies thereof to the Lender on or before the
      thirtieth day after payment. If the Lender determines it has received or been
      granted a credit against or relief or remission for, or repayment of, any taxes
      paid or payable by it because of any taxes, penalties or interest paid by the
      Borrower and evidenced by such a tax receipt, Lender shall, to the extent it
      can
      do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit, relief,
      remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower such amount as Lender determines
      is
      attributable to such deduction or withholding and which will leave Lender (after
      such payment) in no better or worse position than it would have been in if
      the
      Borrower had not been required to make such deduction or withholding. Nothing
      in
      this Agreement shall interfere with the right of the Lender to arrange its
      tax
      affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit nor oblige the Lender to disclose
      any
      information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in connection with
      such taxes. 

Section
      11.2        No
      Waiver of Rights   . 
      No delay or failure on the part of the Lender or on the part of the holder
      or
      holders of the Note in the exercise of any power or right under any Credit
      Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor as an acquiescence in any
      default, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other
      or
      further exercise of any other power or right, and the rights and remedies
      hereunder of the Lender and/or the holder or holders of the Note are cumulative
      to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would
      otherwise have. 

24 

Section
      11.3        Non-Business
      Day   .

      and
      the Loans at the time owing to it);    provided

      obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
      Assumption covering all of the Lender s rights and obligations under this
      Agreement, Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be
      entitled to the benefits of Sections 9.3 and 11.1 with respect to facts and
      circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any
      assignment or transfer by Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement

         Lender
      and/or any holder of the Note may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
      to, the Borrower, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person
      or a Borrower or any of the Borrower s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
    Participant    )

      or a portion of Lender s or such holder s rights and/or obligations under this
      Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or
      the Loans owing to it);    provided   
      that
      (i) Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged,

      Agreement;    provided   
      that
      such agreement or instrument may provide that Lender will not, without the
      consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
      of
      the type described in Section 11.13(i) that directly affects such Participant.
      Subject to paragraph (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
      Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.11, Section 9.3
      and
      Section 11.7 to the same extent as if it were Lender and had acquired its
      interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. Lender
      shall keep a register, meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section
      5f.103-1(c), of each participant, specifying such participant s entitlement to
      payments of principal and interest with respect to such
      participation. 

(c)       Limitations
      upon Participant Rights.    A
      Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section
      2.11, Section 9.3 or Section 11.7 than the Lender would have been entitled
      to
      receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
      the
      sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior
      written consent. 

(d)        Certain
      Pledges.    The
      Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
      portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of the Lender,
      including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
      to a
      Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release
      Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee
      or
      assignee for Lender as a party hereto.       Certain
      Funding Arrangements.     Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained herein, Lender may grant to a special purpose

      identified as such in writing from time to time by the Lender and the Borrower,
      the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Loan that the
      Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this
      Agreement;    provided   
      that (i)
      nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
      if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
      all
      or any part of such Loan, the Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
      pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall
      utilize the Revolving Credit Commitment of the Lender to the same extent, and
      as
      if, such Loan were made by the Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that
      no
      SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
      Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Lender). In furtherance
      of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive
      the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year
      and

      arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United
      States or any State thereof arising out of any claim relating to the Credit
      Documents. In addition, notwithstanding

      to the contrary contained in this Section 11.12(b), any SPC may (i) with notice
      to, but without the prior written consent of, the Borrower, assign all or a
      portion of its interests in any Loan to the Lender or to any financial
      institutions (consented to by the Borrower and Lender) providing liquidity
      and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding
      or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
      information relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer

      agrees to indemnify the Lender and its directors, agents, officers and
      employees, against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments,
      liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable expenses

In
        accordance with Section 14 of the   trust
        agreement for the Amended and Restated Trust Under Peoples Energy Corporation
        (the "Company") Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, Directors Stock And
        Option
        Plan, Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, and Supplemental Retirement Benefit
        Plan, effective March 1, 2004   (the
        "Trust Agreement"), the Company and The Northern Trust Company (the "Trustee")
        hereby amend the Trust Agreement, effective    July 24   ,
        2006 as
        follows:  

1.    
             
                Section
                1(f) of the Trust Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the first
                sentence and replacing it with the
                following: 

Upon
        a
        Change of Control (as defined herein), the Company shall, as soon as possible,
        but in no event longer than 10 business days following the Change of Control,
        make an irrevocable contribution to the Trust in an amount that is sufficient
        to
        pay each Participant or Beneficiary the benefits to which such Participant
        or
        Beneficiary would be entitled pursuant to the terms of the Plans as of the
        date
        on which such Change of Control occurred, except to the extent the Company
        receives a waiver from any Participant or Beneficiary waiving any right to
        receive any portion of such Participant's or Beneficiary's benefits from
        the
        Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall have no duty to
        determine whether such irrevocable contribution by the Company is in an amount
        sufficient to pay such benefits or to enforce any contribution obligation
        of the
        Company, or to determine whether a waiver has been obtained. 

All
        provisions of the Trust Agreement not specifically mentioned in this Amendment
        shall be considered modified to the extent necessary to be consistent with
        the
        changes made in this Amendment. 

IN
