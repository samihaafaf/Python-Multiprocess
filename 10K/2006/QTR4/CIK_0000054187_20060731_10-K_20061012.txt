PART I    
    Item 1.      Business.     
        J.W. Mays, Inc. (the  Company  or  Registrant ) with executive offices at 9 Bond Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201, operates a number of commercial real estate properties, which are described in Item 2  Properties . The Company s business was founded in 1924 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on July 6, 1927.  
        The Company discontinued its department store business which operated under the name of  MAYS , in the year ended July 31, 1989, and has continued the leasing of real estate. The Company has no foreign operations.  
        The Company employs approximately 30 employees and has a contract, expiring November 30, 2007, with a union covering rates of pay, hours of employment and other conditions of employment for approximately 20% of its employees. The Company considers that its labor relations with its employees and union are good.  
   Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   
        This Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements which include assumptions about future market conditions, operations and financial results. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. They are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company s actual results, performance or achievements in the future could differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements discussed or implied in such forward-looking statements herein and in prior Securities and Exchange Commission filings by the Company. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or to advise of changes in the assumptions on which they were based.  
        Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, changes in the competitive environment of the Company, general economic and business conditions, industry trends, changes in government rules and regulations and environmental rules and regulations. Statements concerning interest rates and other financial instrument fair values and their estimated contribution to the Company s future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. This market information is often a function of significant judgment and estimation. Further, market interest rates are subject to significant volatility.  
    Item 1A.      Risk Factors.     
         Risks Relating to Ownership Structure   
        The controlling shareholder group may be able to vote its shares in favor of its interests that may not always coincide with the interests of shareholders not part of such group. This risk may be counter-balanced to a degree by the actions of the Board of Directors whose composition is made up of a majority of independent directors.  
        The controlling shareholder group includes a corporation that owns a significant percentage of the Company s common stock and which does business with the Company, as further described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In theory, this could result in a conflict of interest; nevertheless, the Company and its largest shareholder have put in place some controls to reduce the effects of any perceived conflict of interest.  
        Certain conflicts of interest may be perceived by the relationship between the Company and its largest shareholder. Both entities use the same outside auditors, both entities have the same Chief Executive Officer, and certain management personnel work for both entities. Nevertheless, the Company s Board of Directors is composed of a majority of independent directors. As recently as 2005, in a case involving both entities, the Delaware Supreme Court in connection with an attempt to obtain books and records of the Company through a proceeding against the Company s significant shareholder, held that the actions of the Company s Board were proper.

Risks Related to Our Business   
        We are a part of the communities in which we do business. Accordingly, like other businesses in our communities, we are subject to the following risks:  

the continued threat of terrorism;   

economic downturns, both on a national and on local scales;   

loss of key personnel;   

the availability, if needed, of additional financing;   

the continued availability of insurance (in different types of policies) at reasonably acceptable rates; and   

the general burdens of governmental regulation, at the Local, State and Federal levels.   
 
         Risks Related to Real Estate Operations   
        Our investment in property development may be limited by increasing costs required to  fit up  property to be leased to tenants. Also, as the cost of fitting up properties increases, we may be required to wait and forsake opportunities that would be revenue producing until such time that we obtain the necessary financing of such ventures. This risk may be mitigated by our obtaining of lines of credit and other financing vehicles, although such have significant limitations on the amounts that may be borrowed at any point in time.  
        We also may be subject to environmental liability as an owner or operator of properties. Many of our properties are old and when we need to fit up a property for a new tenant, we may find materials and the like that could be deemed to contain hazardous elements requiring remediation or encapsulation.  
        There are also risks associated with non-renewals of leases by the Company s landlords and the loss of major tenants. The Company is trying to mitigate the latter by leasing our properties to multiple tenants where applicable in order to diversify the tenant base.  
         Risks Related to our Investments   
        Excess cash and cash equivalents may be invested from time to time. We seek to earn rates of return that will help us finance our business operations. These investments may be subject to significant uncertainties and may not be successful for many reasons, including, but not limited to the following:  

fluctuations in interest rates;   

worsening of general economic and market conditions; and   

adverse legal and regulatory developments that may affect a particular business.   
 
         Risk Factors Summary   
        These are some of the  Risk Factors  that could affect the Company s business. The Company endeavors to take actions and do business in a way that reduces these  Risk Factors  or, at least, takes them into account when conducting its business. Nevertheless, some of these  Risk Factors  cannot be avoided so that the Company must also take actions and do business that negates the adverse effects that these may have on the ongoing business of the Company.

    Item 3.      Legal Proceedings.     
        There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the Company. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    Item 4.      Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.     
        During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report, no matter was submitted to a vote of security holders of the Company.

Executive Officers of the Registrant    
        The following information is furnished with respect to each Executive Officer of the Registrant (each of whose position is reviewed annually but each of whom has a three-year employment agreement, effective August 1, 2005), whose present term of office will expire upon the election and qualifications of his successor:  
 
        All of the above mentioned officers have been appointed as such by the directors and have been employed as Executive Officers of the Company during the past five years.  
    PART II    
    Item 5.      Market for Registrant s Common Stock and Related Shareholder Matters.     
        The information appearing under the heading  Common Stock and Dividend Information  on pages 22-23 of the Registrant s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference.  
    Item 6.      Selected Financial Data.     
        The information appearing under the heading  Summary of Selected Financial Data  on page 2 of the Registrant s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference.  
    Item 7.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     
        The information appearing under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  on pages 19 through 22 of the Registrant s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference.  
    Item 7A.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.     
        The Company uses both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt to finance its capital requirements. These transactions expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments. At July 31, 2006, the Company had fixed-rate debt of $7,841,621 and variable rate debt of $6,193,735. Because of the extension of the Fishkill, New York property loan and the Bond Street building, Brooklyn, New York and the Jowein building, Brooklyn, New York loans (presently with balances of $1,834,726, $3,379,009 and $980,000, respectively), if interest rates were to change 100 basis points, the effect on net income from operations and future cash flows would be a decrease, should the rates increase, or an increase, should the rates decline, of $61,937 for these loans.

Item. 8.      Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     
        The Registrant s Consolidated Financial Statements, together with the report of D Arcangelo   Co., LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, dated October 6, 2006, appearing on pages 4 through 17 of the Registrant s 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders is incorporated herein by reference. With the exception of the aforementioned information and the information incorporated by reference in Items 2, 5, 6, and 7 hereof, the 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders is not to be deemed filed as part of this Form 10-K Annual Report.  
    Item 9.      Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.     
        There are no disagreements between the Company and its accountants relating to accounting or financial disclosures.  
    Item 9A.      Controls and Procedures.     
   (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.   
        The Company s management reviewed the Company s internal controls and procedures and the effectiveness of these controls. As of July 31, 2006, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in its periodic SEC filings.  
   (b) Change to internal controls.   
        There was no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.  
        Our accounting department is comprised of four persons. Due to such a limited number of persons, a complete segregation of all of the duties as to which the department is responsible is not possible. In order to make sure that the inability to segregate all duties does not affect our timely and accurate financial reporting, we need to remain vigilant in maintaining compensating controls. These compensating controls will continue to be monitored in order to assure us that our internal controls over financial reporting remain at a high level despite the limited number of accounting department personnel.  
    PART III    
    Item 10.      Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant.     
        The information relating to directors of the Registrant is contained in the Definitive Proxy Statement for the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and such information is incorporated herein by reference.

        We have audited the consolidated financial statements of J.W.

Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedules of J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries referred to in Item 15(a)2 of this Form 10-K. These consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our audits. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

        During fiscal 2006, the Company leased 10,000 square feet for office use to one tenant in the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. Rent commenced in October 2005. The Company also leased 13,026 square feet for office use to a tenant in the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. Rent commenced August 2006. The Company also entered into three lease agreements with an existing tenant at the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. One lease agreement is for 12,000 square feet and will be used for offices, and the rent commenced in March 2006. The second lease agreement is for 2,505 square feet and will be used as part of the tenant s retail operation, and the rent commenced in November 2005. The third lease agreement is for 7,411 square feet and will be used for office
space, and the rent commenced in October 2006.  
        In August and September 2006, the Company entered into three additional lease agreements. Two of the agreements were for retail use at the Company s Jamaica, New York building. One tenant leased 47,100 square feet and the other tenant leased 28,335 square feet. These tenants replaced the tenants who vacated the premises in February 2006 and June 2006, respectively. Rent is anticipated to commence in June 2007 and November 2006, respectively. The rental income from these lease agreements will more than offset the rental income lost from the previous tenants. The third lease agreement is for 10,000 square feet and will be used for office space at the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. Rent is anticipated to commence in November 2006. The costs of construction to the Company for these tenants will be
minor.  
        The increased rentals from the additional tenants and the Company s multiple draw term loan should adequately cover the Company s planned operating and capital requirements.  
        We are continuing to actively pursue government agencies, educational institutions and prospective corporate tenants which may be seeking office or retail space in our properties.  
        I believe our Company is well-positioned to continue its growth, and I want to thank the personnel of Mays and our Board colleagues for their continuing commitment and support.

    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:   
        CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, a New York corporation and its subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned. Material intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation.  
        ACCOUNTING RECORDS AND USE OF ESTIMATES: The accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). The preparation of the Company s financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the reported consolidated statements of income and retained earnings, comprehensive income and the consolidated balance sheets and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
        RENTAL INCOME: All of the real estate owned by the Company is held for leasing to tenants except for a small portion used for Company offices. Rent is recognized from tenants under executed leases no later than on an established date or on an earlier date if the tenant should commence conducting business. Unbilled receivables represent the excess of scheduled rental income recognized on a straight-line basis over rental income as it becomes receivable according to the provisions of the lease. Contingent rental income is recorded when earned and is not based on tenant revenue. Based upon its periodic assessment of the quality of the receivables, management, using its historical knowledge of the tenants and industry experience, determines whether a reserve or write-off is required.  
        MARKETABLE SECURITIES: The Company categorizes marketable securities as either trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in income. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a separate component of shareholders  equity. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Dividends and interest income are accrued as earned. Realized gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis. The Company reviews marketable securities for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. The Company did not classify any securities as trading during the three years ended
July 31, 2006.  
        PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and the declining-balance method. Amortization of improvements to leased property is calculated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements. Lives used to determine depreciation and amortization are generally as follows:  
 
        Maintenance, repairs, renewals and improvements of a non-permanent nature are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for additions and major renewals or improvements are capitalized. The cost of assets sold or retired and the accumulated depreciation or amortization thereon are eliminated from the respective accounts in the year of disposal, and the resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to income. Capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life.  
        The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. At July 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no impairments of its property and equipment.  
        COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 130,  Reporting Comprehensive Income , establishes standards for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components. It requires all items that are required to be recognized as components of comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other income statement information.  
  8  

Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders.  
        DEFERRED CHARGES: Deferred charges consist principally of costs incurred in connection with the leasing of property to tenants. Such costs are amortized over the related lease periods, ranging from 1 to 21 years, using the straight-line method.  
        INCOME TAXES: Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company s assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets result principally from the recording of certain accruals and reserves which currently are not deductible for tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities result principally from temporary differences in the recognition of gains and losses from certain investments and from the use, for tax purposes, of accelerated depreciation.  
        INCOME PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK: Income per share has been computed by dividing net income for the year by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year, adjusted for the purchase of treasury stock. Shares used in computing income per share were 2,015,780 in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004.  
   2. Marketable Securities:   
        As of July 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company s marketable securities were classified as follows:  
 
        Investment income for the years ended July 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 consists of the following:  
 
  9  

3. Long-Term Debt Mortgages and Term Loan:   
 
        (a) The Company, on September 11, 1996, closed a loan with a bank in the amount of $4,000,000. The loan is secured by a first mortgage lien covering the entire leasehold interest of the Company, as tenant, in a certain ground lease and building in the Jamaica, New York property. The outstanding balance of the loan, totaling $1,355,555, will become due and payable on April 1, 2007.  
        (b) The Company, on December 13, 2000, closed a loan with a bank in the amount of $3,500,000. The loan is secured by a second position leasehold mortgage covering the entire leasehold interest of the Company, as tenant, in a certain ground lease and building in the Jamaica, New York property. The outstanding balance of the loan, totaling $2,739,452 will become due and payable on October 1, 2006. The Company has the option to extend this loan for an additional five (5) years. The interest rate for the extended period will be 2.25% above the 5-year treasury rate in effect on the first maturity date. The Company exercised its option to extend the loan for the additional five (5) years. At the end of the five-year period there will be a balance due on the loan, which will be determined when the interest rate is finalized.  
  Payments are made, in arrears, on the first day of each and every month calculated during the ten (10) year period of the term loan, at the sum of the interest rate plus amortization sufficient to fully liquidate the loan over a fifteen (15) year period. As additional collateral security, the Company will conditionally assign to the bank all leases and rents on the premises, or portions thereof, whether now existing or hereafter consummated. The Company has an option to prepay principal, in whole or in part, plus interest accrued thereon, at any time during the term, without premium or penalty. Other provisions of the loan agreement provide certain restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness on the Jamaica property and the sale or transfer of the Company s ground lease interest in the premises.  
        (c) The Company, on May 7, 2004, closed a loan with an affiliated corporation owned by members, including certain directors of the Company, of the family of the late Joe Weinstein, former Chairman of the Board of Directors, in the amount of $1,350,000. The term of the loan is for a period of five (5) years at an interest rate of 9.00% per annum. Interest and amortization of principal are paid quarterly based on a fifteen (15) year level amortization period. The constant quarterly payments of interest and principal are $40,316. The funds were used to purchase a one-half interest in a property that is part of the Company s Brooklyn, New York building (Bond Street building). The outstanding balance of the loan, totaling $1,056,007, will become due and payable on April 1, 2009.  
        (d) On June 2, 1999, the existing first mortgage loan balance on the Fishkill, New York property was extended for a period of five years. Under the terms of the extension agreement, the annual interest rate was reduced from 9% to 8.25% and the interest and principal payments were made in constant monthly amounts based upon a fifteen (15) year payout period. On August 19, 2004 the Company extended the loan for an  
  10  

additional forty-two (42) months, with an option to convert the loan to a seven (7) year permanent mortgage loan. The payments for the extended period of forty-two (42) months will be interest only on the amount owing at a floating rate per annum equal to the one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.25%, but not less than 3.40%. The payments for the seven-year permanent mortgage loan would be on a seventeen (17) year level amortization, plus interest. The interest rate on the permanent loan would be a fixed rate equal to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York s seven-year (7) fixed interest rate plus 2.25% per annum. (See Note 3(e)).  
        (e) The Company, on August 19, 2004, closed a loan with a bank for a $12,000,000 multiple draw term loan. This loan finances seventy-five (75%) percent of the cost of capital improvements for an existing lease to a tenant and capital improvements for future tenant leases at the Company s Brooklyn, New York (Bond Street building) and Fishkill, New York properties. The loan also refinanced the existing mortgage on the Company s Fishkill, New York property which matured on July 1, 2004 (see Note 3(d)). The Company will have three and one-half years to draw down amounts under this loan. The loan consists of: a) a permanent, first mortgage loan to refinance an existing first mortgage loan affecting the Fishkill Property (the  First Permanent Loan ) (see Note 3(d)), b) a permanent subordinate mortgage loan
in the amount $1,870,000 (the  Second Permanent Loan ), and c) multiple, successively subordinate loans in the amount $8,295,274 ( Subordinate Building Loans ). The loan is structured in two phases: 1) a forty-two month loan with payments of interest only at the floating one-month LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, but not less than 3.40%; and 2) after the forty-two month period, the loan would convert to a seven-year (7) permanent mortgage loan on a seventeen (17) year level amortization, plus interest, at the option of the Company. The interest rate on the permanent loan would be at a fixed rate equal to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York s seven-year (7) fixed interest rate plus 2.25% per annum at the time of conversion. As of August 19, 2004, the Company refinanced the existing mortgage on the Company s Fishkill, New York property, which balance was $1,834,726
and took down an additional $2,820,000 for capital improvements for two tenants at the Company s Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. On May 9, 2006, the Company drew down an additional $559,009 on its multiple draw term loan to finance tenant improvements for the leasing of 13,026 square feet for office use at the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. The total amount to be financed for tenant improvements and brokerage commissions will be $916,661. The outstanding balance as of July 31, 2006 was $5,213,735.  
        (f) On February 18, 2005, the Company secured financing in the amount of $1,700,000, from a bank whose president is a director of the Company. The loan was used to finance the construction costs and brokerage commissions associated with the leasing of 28,801 square feet for office use to a tenant at the Company s Jowein building, in Brooklyn, New York. The loan is a multiple draw loan, for a period of five (5) years, and is self-amortizing, at an interest rate of 6.50% per annum.  
        (g) The Company, on July 22, 2005, closed a loan with a bank for $1,200,000. The loan will be used to finance the construction costs and brokerage commissions associated with the leasing of 15,000 square feet for office use to a tenant at the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. The loan will be secured by the assignment of lease of 15,000 square feet. The loan is for a period of five (5) years and is self-amortizing, at a floating interest rate of prime plus 1.00% per annum.  
        Maturities of long-term debt-mortgages payable outstanding at July 31, 2006, are as follows: Years ending July 31, 2007 (included in current liabilities); $2,338,492; 2008; $6,059,828; 2009; $1,929,305; 2010; $802,616; 2011; $275,098; and 2012; $1,630,017.  
        Interest paid to related parties for the three years ended July 31, 2006 was $111,840, $120,179, and $44,862, respectively.  
  11  

4. Income Taxes:

   5. Leases:   
        The Company s real estate operations encompass both owned and leased properties. The current leases on leased property, most of which have options to extend the terms, range from 1 year to 25 years. Certain of the leases provide for additional rentals under certain circumstances and obligate the Company for payments of real estate taxes and other expenses.  
        Rental expense for leased real property for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended July 31, 2006 was exceeded by sublease rental income, as follows:

        Future minimum non-cancelable rental commitments for operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are payable as follows:  
 
        * Minimum payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $37,297,209 under operating leases due in the future under non-cancelable leases.  
  13  

6. Rental Income:   
        Rental income for each of the fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows:  
 
        Future minimum non-cancelable rental income for leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more is as follows:

   9. Cash Flow Information:   
        For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash equivalents to consist of short-term highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, which are readily convertible into cash.  
        Supplemental disclosures:  
 
   10. Financial Instruments and Credit Risk Concentrations:   
        The following disclosure of estimated fair value was determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. Considerable judgment is necessary to develop estimates of fair value. The estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments.  
        The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using the following methods and assumptions: (i) quoted market prices, when available, are used to estimate the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities; (ii) discounted cash flow analyses are used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt, using the Company s estimate of current interest rates for similar debt; and (iii) carrying amounts in the balance sheet approximate fair value for cash and cash equivalents and tenant security deposits due to their high liquidity.  
 
        Financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents and receivables. Marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents are placed with high credit quality financial institutions and instruments to minimize risk.  
        The Company derives rental income from forty-eight tenants, of which one tenant accounted for 16.85% and another tenant accounted for 13.23% of rental income during the year ended July 31, 2006. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of rental income during the year ended July 31, 2006.  
        The Company has two irrevocable letters of credit totaling $137,500 at July 31, 2006 and July 31, 2005, provided by two tenants.  
  15

        Deferred charges for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2006 and 2005 consist of the following:  
 
        The aggregate amortization expense for the three years in the period ended July 31, 2006 was $474,691, $310,695, and $519,058, respectively.  
        The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:  
 
   12. Capitalization:   
        The Company is capitalized entirely through common stock with identical voting rights and rights to liquidation. Treasury stock is recorded at cost and consists of 162,517 shares at July 31, 2006 and at July 31, 2005.  
   13. Note Payable:   
        On December 15, 2004, the Company borrowed $1,000,000 from a director of the Company, who is also a greater than 10% beneficial owner of the outstanding common stock of the Company. The term of the loan is for a period of three (3) years maturing on December 15, 2007, at an interest rate of 7.50% per annum. The loan is unsecured. The note is prepayable in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The funds were used towards the purchase of a one-half interest in a parcel which is part of the Company s Brooklyn, New York properties. The total purchase price was $1,500,000. The constant quarterly payments of interest are $18,750. The interest paid for the years ended July 31, 2006 and 2005 was $75,000 and $46,875, respectively.  
   14. Contingencies:   
        There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the Company. It is the opinion of management that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.

    Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders 
J.W. Mays, Inc. and Subsidiaries  
        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  
        We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  
        In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of J.W. Mays, Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

J.W. MAYS, INC. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  
Results of Operations 

Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005   
        Net income for the year ended July 31, 2006 amounted to $1,433,382, or $.71 per share, compared to net income for the year ended July 31, 2005 of $348,368, or $.17 per share.  
        Revenues in the current year increased to $13,166,177 from $12,882,965 in the comparable 2005 fiscal year. The increase in revenues was due to the Company s leasing to three office tenants at its Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York, the leasing to a retail tenant at its Jamaica, New York building, the recovery of real estate taxes, partially offset by two retail tenants vacating the Jamaica, New York building and the office tenant vacating the Fishkill, New York building.  
        The recovery of real estate taxes in the current year in the amount of $195,605, net of legal expenses, represents prior years  real estate taxes from two of the Company s properties.  
        Real estate operating expenses in the current year increased to $7,855,318 from $7,321,272 in the comparable 2005 year primarily due to increases in rental expense, real estate taxes, maintenance costs, utility costs, leasing commissions and licenses and permits, partially offset by decreases in insurance costs.  
        Administrative and general expenses in the current year increased to $3,011,080 from $2,764,210 in the comparable 2005 year primarily due to increases in payroll costs, insurance costs, legal and professional costs, and bad debt expense due to a tenant vacating the Company s Jamaica, New York building.  
        Depreciation and amortization expense in the current year increased to $1,544,419 from $1,464,883 in the comparable 2005 year primarily due to depreciation on the additional improvements to the Brooklyn, New York and the Jamaica, New York properties and acquisitions of the three parcels in Brooklyn, New York.  
        Investment income exceeded interest expense and other expenses by $1,137,022 in fiscal 2006, and was exceeded by interest expense and other expenses by $641,232 in the comparable 2005 year. The investment income increase in the 2006 year was due to the gain on the sale of one of the Company s marketable securities, which was caused by a merger, scheduled repayments of debt, partially offset by increased interest expense on the additional loans and increases in interest rates with banks and a note payable from a director.  
   Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004   
        Net income for the year ended July 31, 2005 amounted to $348,368, or $.17 per share, compared to net income for the year ended July 31, 2004 of $1,135,466, or $.56 per share.  
        Revenues in fiscal 2005 decreased to $12,882,965 from $14,020,571 in the comparable 2004 fiscal year. The decrease in revenues was due to the New York City Department of Finance vacating the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York in June 2004, and the tenant vacating the Levittown, New York premises in September 2004, partially offset by the revenues from the Company s leasing to two office tenants at its Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York, the leasing to three office tenants at its Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York, and the leasing to a retail tenant at its Jamaica, New York building.  
        Real estate operating expenses in fiscal 2005 decreased to $7,321,272 from $7,715,493 in the comparable 2004 year primarily due to decreases in rental expense, insurance costs, maintenance costs, leasing commissions and licenses and permits, partially offset by increases in real estate taxes, payroll costs, and utility costs.  
        Administrative and general expenses in fiscal 2005 decreased to $2,764,210 from $2,771,106 in the comparable 2004 year primarily due to decreases in medical costs and legal and professional costs, partially offset by an increase in payroll costs.  
        Depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2005 increased to $1,464,883 from $1,317,522 in the comparable 2004 year primarily due to depreciation on the additional improvements to the Brooklyn, New York and the Jamaica, New York properties and acquisitions of the three parcels in Brooklyn, New York.  
        Interest expense and other expenses exceeded investment income by $641,232 in fiscal 2005 and by $293,984 in the comparable 2004 year. The increase was due primarily to increased interest expense on the  
  19  

additional loans with banks, a note payable from a director, a decrease in income due to the gains on the sale of the Company s marketable securities in the 2004 year, and a decrease in dividend income due to the sale of the Company s marketable securities, partially offset by scheduled repayments of debt.  
        The income tax provision for the year ended July 31, 2005 is approximately fifty percent of income before income taxes, compared to approximately forty-one percent in the year ended July 31, 2004. The increase in the tax percent was caused by the state and city tax provision in the year ended July 31, 2005 being based on capital and in the year ended July 31, 2004, it was based on income.  
   Liquidity and Capital Resources:   
        The Company has been operating as a real estate enterprise since the discontinuance of the retail department store segment of its operations on January 3, 1989.  
        Management considers current working capital and borrowing capabilities adequate to cover the Company s planned operating and capital requirements. The Company s cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2,335,328 at July 31, 2006.  
        In March 2005 and in October 2005, the Company leased 15,000 square feet and 10,000 square feet, respectively, for office use to two tenants at the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. This space was a portion of the space previously leased to the City of New York Department of Finance, which vacated the premises in June 2004. Rent commenced in October 2005 for both tenants. The Company also leased 13,026 square feet for office use to a tenant in the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. Rent commenced in August 2006.  
        The Company, in August 2005, entered into two lease agreements with an existing tenant at the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. One lease agreement is for 12,000 square feet and will be used for offices and the rent commenced in March 2006. The other lease agreement is for 2,505 square feet and will be used as part of the tenant s retail operation, and rent commenced in November 2005. The Company, in March 2006, leased an additional 7,411 square feet to this same tenant for office space at the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. Rent commenced in October 2006.  
        The Company was informed by a tenant, who occupies 47,100 square feet of rental space at its Jamaica, New York property, that the tenant would not be exercising its option to extend its lease agreement. The tenant vacated the premises on February 28, 2006. The annual loss in rental income to the Company will be approximately $600,000. The Company was informed by a tenant at the Company s Jamaica, New York property of its intention to vacate the premises in June 2006. The annual loss in rental income from this tenant is approximately $300,000.  
        The lease with the tenant that leased the entire premises at the Company s Circleville, Ohio building, under a triple-net lease, lease extension and modification expired September 30, 2005. The tenant entered into a further lease extension and modification agreement for part of the premises, 75,000 square feet, for a period of five years, with a right to cancel after three years, to expire on November 11, 2010. The Company has engaged brokers to pursue tenants for the remaining 118,000 square feet of space available for leasing. The Company is also considering selling its Circleville, Ohio property in order to produce additional working capital in case additional capital requirements becomes necessary.  
        On October 11, 2005, a tenant in our Jowein building filed for Chapter 11 protection. This tenant accounted for 5% of our annual income for the year ended July 31, 2006. Pursuant to an amendment to the lease and the assumption and assignment of the lease to PLVTZ, LLC and the Pride Capital Group (d/b/a Great American Group) ( PLVTZ ), the Company has assigned the Lease to PLVTZ and reduced the rent payable under the lease by 12% for the first year ($84,905) commencing April 1, 2006 ( Commencement Date ), and 10% during the second year ($70,754) after the Commencement Date. In addition, the Company has agreed to waive certain pre-petition arrears owed by the tenant ($49,427).  
        The tenant at the Company s Fishkill, New York property, whose lease expired on November 26, 2005, did not renew the lease and vacated the premises. The annual loss in rental income from this tenant is approximately $180,000. The Company is actively seeking, through brokers, tenants to occupy the vacated space.  
        On May 9, 2006, the Company drew down an additional $559,009 on its multiple draw term loan, to finance tenant improvements for the leasing of 13,026 square feet for office use at the Company s 9 Bond Street building  
  20  

in Brooklyn, New York. The total amount to be financed for tenant improvements and brokerage commissions will be $916,661. (See Note 3(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  
        In August and September 2006, the Company entered into three additional lease agreements. Two of the lease agreements were for retail use at the Company s Jamaica, New York building. One tenant leased 47,100 square feet and the other tenant leased 28,335 square feet. These tenants replaced the tenants who vacated the premises in February 2006 and June 2006, respectively. Rent is anticipated to commence in June 2007 and November 2006, respectively. The rental income from these lease agreements will more than offset the rental income lost from the previous tenants. The third lease agreement is for 10,000 square feet and will be used for office space at the Company s Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. Rent is anticipated to commence in November 2006. The cost of construction to the Company for these tenants will
be minor.  
   Contractual Obligations:   
        At July 31, 2006, the Company had certain contractual cash obligations, as set forth in the following tables:  
 
   Cash Flows From Operating Activities:   
         Prepaid Expenses:    Expenditures for the year ended July 31, 2006 increased by $167,764 compared to the period ended July 31, 2005, due to increases in real estate taxes and insurance premiums paid.  
         Deferred Expenses:    The Company had expenditures for brokerage commissions in the year ended July 31, 2006, in the amount of $209,578, relating to tenants at its Brooklyn, New York properties.  
         Payroll and Other Accrued Liabilities:    The Company paid $150,899 for commissions incurred in order to lease space at the Company s properties in the year ended July 31, 2006. The original amount of the brokerage commissions was $1,302,243. As of July 31, 2006, $1,049,076 had been paid. The Company also incurred additional brokerage commissions in the amount of $209,578 relating to two tenants.  
   Cash Flows From Investing Activities:   
        The Company had expenditures of $530,557 for the year ended July 31, 2006 for the renovation of 15,000 square feet for office space for a tenant at its Jowein building in Brooklyn, New York. The cost of the project was $1,054,989 and was completed in September 2005.  
        The Company had expenditures of $266,820 for the year ended July 31, 2006 for the renovations to an existing tenant at the Company s Jamaica, New York property. The tenant was on a month to month lease agreement and upon completion of the renovations the lease agreement became a ten-year lease with increased rental income. The total cost of the project was $276,820 and was completed in December 2005.  
        The Company had expenditures of $1,075,000 for the year ended July 31, 2006 for the renovation of 13,026 square feet of office space for a tenant at its 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. The cost of the project was $1,075,000 and was completed in June 2006.  
   Cash Flows From Financing Activities:   
         Borrowing:    The Company drew down an additional $559,009 on its multiple draw term loan, to finance tenant improvements for the leasing of 13,026 square feet for office use at the Company s 9 Bond Street building in Brooklyn, New York. The total amount to be financed for tenant improvements and brokerage commissions will be $916,661. (See Note 3(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  
  21  

Lease security:    The Company increased tenant security deposits by $114,946 due to the leasing of space to six tenants at the Company s Brooklyn, New York properties.  
    Controls and Procedures:    
        The Company s management reviewed the Company s internal controls and procedures and the effectiveness of these controls. As of July 31, 2006, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in its periodic SEC filings.  
        There was no change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.  
        Our accounting department is comprised of four persons. Due to such a limited number of persons, a complete segregation of all of the duties as to which the department is responsible is not possible. In order to make sure that the inability to segregate all duties does not affect our timely and accurate financial reporting, we need to remain vigilant in maintaining compensating controls. These compensating controls will continue to be monitored in order to assure us that our internal controls over financial reporting remain at a high level despite the limited number of accounting department personnel.  
    Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)
