FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS             The Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements. This report contains information that may be deemed forward-looking, that is based largely on the Company s current expectations, and is subject to
certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Among such risks, trends and other uncertainties are changes in advertising demand, newsprint prices, energy costs, interest rates,
labor costs, legislative and regulatory rulings and other results of operations or financial conditions, difficulties in integration of acquired businesses or maintaining employee and customer relationships and increased capital and other costs. The
words  may,   will,   would,   could,   believes,   expects,   anticipates,   intends,   plans,   projects,   considers  and similar
expressions generally identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are made as of the date of this report. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or
revise its forward-looking statements.             PART I             References to 2006, 2005, 2004 and the like mean the fiscal years ended September 30.   
         
  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS             The Company directly, and
through its ownership of associated companies, publishes 56 daily newspapers in 23 states and more than 300 weekly, classified and specialty publications, along with associated and integrated online sites. The Company was founded in 1890,
incorporated in 1950, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1978. Before 2001, the Company also operated a number of network-affiliated and satellite television stations. In 2006, the Company sold the assets of its publishing and commercial
printing operations in Seattle and Spokane, Washington and Portland, Oregon.            The Company
is consistently focused on six key strategic priorities. They are to:         

Grow revenue creatively and rapidly;     

Emphasize strong local news;     

Accelerate our online innovation;     

Increase circulation, readership and online audiences;     

Nurture employee development and achievement; and     

Exercise careful cost control.              Certain aspects of these priorities are discussed below.             HOWARD
AND SIOUX CITY ACQUISITIONS             In 2002, the Company acquired 15 daily newspapers and a
50% interest in the Sioux City, Iowa daily newspaper (SCN) by purchasing Howard Publications, Inc. (Howard). This acquisition was consistent with the strategy the Company announced in 2000 to buy daily newspapers with circulation of 30,000 or more.
In 2002, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% of SCN. These acquisitions increased the Company s circulation by more than 75% and increased its revenue by nearly 50%. In February 2004, two daily newspapers acquired in the Howard
acquisition were exchanged for daily newspapers in Burley, Idaho and Elko, Nevada.             PULITZER ACQUISITION             In June 2005, the Company acquired Pulitzer Inc.
(Pulitzer). Pulitzer published 14 daily newspapers and more than 100 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also owns a 50% interest in TNI Partners, as described more fully below. The acquisition of Pulitzer increased the
Company s circulation by more than 50%, to more than 1.6 million daily and more than 1.9 million Sunday, and revenue by more than 60%.         
   1   

Table of Contents  

         Pulitzer newspaper operations include St. Louis,
Missouri, where its subsidiary, St. Louis Post-Dispatch LLC (PD LLC), publishes the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch,  the only major daily newspaper serving the greater St. Louis metropolitan area. St. Louis newspaper operations also
include the Suburban Journals, a group of 35 weekly papers and various niche publications that focus on providing local news and editorial content to the communities they serve. In 2006, the Suburban Journals had average unduplicated
circulation of approximately 0.7 million, resulting in the delivery of approximately 1.1 million copies per week.            Pulitzer holds a 95% interest in the results of operations of PD LLC, and The Herald Company, Inc. (Herald) holds a 5% interest.            Pulitzer s wholly-owned subsidiary, Pulitzer Newspapers, Inc. (PNI), and its subsidiaries
published 12 daily newspapers, as well as more than 75 weekly newspapers, shoppers and niche publications, that serve markets in the Midwest, Southwest and West. In 2006, the Company sold the assets of  The Daily News  in Rhinelander,
Wisconsin, the smallest of these newspapers.            In 2005 and 2006, the Company devoted
substantial attention to the successful integration of Pulitzer into its business. The Company made significant and immediate changes to systems and other areas of operations. The Company also devoted resources and training to bring its successful
selling strategies and tactics to Pulitzer. The Company believes the integration was successful, with minimal disruption to the business.             TNI Partners             As a result of the acquisition of Pulitzer, the Company owns a 50% interest in TNI Partners (TNI), the Tucson, Arizona newspaper partnership. TNI, acting as agent for the Company s subsidiary, Star Publishing Company (Star
Publishing), and the owner of the remaining 50%, Citizen Publishing Company (Citizen), a subsidiary of Gannett Co. Inc., is responsible for printing, delivery, advertising, and circulation of the  Arizona Daily Star  and the  Tucson Citizen
 and their related online operations .  TNI collects all receipts and income and pays all operating expenses incident to the partnership s operations and publication of the newspapers. Each newspaper is solely responsible for its own
news and editorial content. Under the amended and restated joint operating agreement between Star Publishing and Citizen (the Agency Agreement), The  Arizona Daily Star  remains the separate property of Star Publishing. Income or loss of TNI
(before income taxes) is allocated equally to Star Publishing and Citizen. Results of TNI are accounted for using the equity method.            The Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 permits joint operating agreements between newspapers under certain circumstances without violation of the Federal antitrust laws. Agency
agreements generally allow newspapers operating in the same market to share certain printing and other facilities and to pool certain revenue and expenses in order to decrease aggregate expenses and thereby allow the continuing operation of multiple
newspapers in the same market. Newspapers in several cities operate under joint operating or agency agreements.            An Agency Agreement has governed the joint operations of the  Arizona Daily Star  and  Tucson Citizen  since 1940 .  The Board of Directors of TNI presently consists
of three directors chosen by Star Publishing and three chosen by Citizen. Budgetary, key personnel and other non-news and editorial policy matters, such as advertising and circulation policies and rates or prices, are determined by the Board of
Directors of TNI. Both the Company and Citizen incur certain administrative costs and capital expenditures that are reported by their individual companies. The  Arizona Daily Star  and the  Tucson Citizen  benefit from increases, and can
be adversely affected by decreases, in each other s circulation. The Agency Agreement expires in 2015, but contains an option, which may be exercised by either party, to renew the agreement for successive periods of 25 years each.
           Due to the agency relationship existing in Tucson, the  Arizona Daily Star  and
 Tucson Citizen  cannot be viewed as competitors for advertising or circulation revenue. The  Arizona Daily Star  and  Tucson Citizen  compete primarily against other media, suburban, neighborhood and national newspapers, and other
publications.

          MADISON NEWSPAPERS             The Company owns 50% of the capital stock of Madison Newspapers, Inc. (MNI) and 17% of the nonvoting
common stock of The Capital Times Company (TCT). TCT owns the remaining 50% of the capital stock of MNI. MNI publishes daily and Sunday newspapers, and other publications in Madison, Wisconsin, and other Wisconsin locations, as well as the related
online sites. MNI conducts business under the trade name Capital Newspapers. The Company has a contract to furnish the editorial and news content for the  Wisconsin State Journal,  which is published by MNI, and periodically provides other
services to MNI. The  Wisconsin State Journal  is classified as one of the Lee group of newspapers in the newspaper business and in the rating services. Results of MNI are accounted for using the equity method. Net income or loss of MNI (after
income taxes) is allocated equally to the Company and TCT. In 2006, MNI sold the assets of its Shawano, Wisconsin daily newspaper.             ADVERTISING             More than 77% of the Company s 2006 revenue was derived from advertising. The Company s strategies are to increase its share of local advertising through increased sales pressure in its existing markets and, over time, to increase
readership and circulation unit sales through internal expansion into existing and contiguous markets and enhancement of online offerings, augmented by selective acquisitions. Acquisition efforts are focused on newspapers with daily circulation of
30,000 or more, as noted above, and other publications and online businesses that expand the Company s operating revenue.            Many of the Company s businesses operate in geographic groups of publications, or  clusters , which provide operational efficiencies and extend sales penetration.
Operational efficiencies are obtained through consolidation of sales forces, back office operations such as finance or human resources, management or production of the publications. Sales penetration can improve if the sales effort is successful in
cross-selling advertising into multiple publications. A table under the caption  Daily Newspapers and Markets  in Item 1 identifies those groups of newspapers operating in clusters.            The Company s newspapers and classified and specialty publications compete with newspapers having
national or regional circulation, magazines, radio, network and cable television, other advertising media such as billboards, other classified and specialty publications, direct mail, yellow pages directories, as well as other information content
providers such as online sites. Competition for advertising is based on audience size and composition, circulation levels, readership demographics, price and advertiser results. In addition, several of the Company s daily and Sunday newspapers
compete with other local daily or weekly newspapers. The Company estimates that it captures more than 50% of the total advertising dollars spent on print, broadcast and online advertising in substantially all of its markets, and approximately 30% in
St. Louis.            The number of competitors in any given market varies, and cannot be estimated
with any degree of certainty. However, all of the forms of competition noted above exist to some degree in the Company s markets, including those listed in the table under the caption  Daily Newspapers and Markets  in Item 1.
           The following broadly define major categories of advertising revenue:             Retail  advertising is revenue earned from sales of display advertising space in
the publication, or for preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, to local accounts.             National  advertising is revenue earned from display advertising space, or for preprinted advertising inserted in the publication, to national accounts, if there is no local retailer representing the account in the
market.             Classified  advertising, which includes employment,
automotive, real estate for sale or rent, and other categories, is revenue earned from sales of advertising space in the classified section of the publication or from publications consisting primarily of such advertising.             Online  advertising consists of display, banner, classified or other advertising
on websites associated and integrated with the Company s print publications.

Table of Contents  

          Niche publications  are
specialty publications, such as lifestyle, business, health or home improvement publications that contain significant amounts of advertising.            Classified publications are periodic advertising publications available in racks or delivered free, by carriers or third-class mail, to all, or selected, households in a particular
geographic area. Classified publications offer advertisers a cost-effective local advertising system and are particularly effective in larger markets with high media fragmentation.            The Company s many geographic markets have differences in their advertising rate structures, some of which are highly complex. A single operation
often has scores of rate alternatives.           

            The chart above compares newspaper advertising spending, as
measured by the Newspaper Association of America (NAA), and the Company s same property advertising revenue, for the last eleven fiscal quarters, the period for which comparable information is available. See Item 7, Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on same property comparisons. The advertising environment is influenced by the state of the overall economy, including unemployment rates, inflation,
energy prices and consumer interest rates. The Company s enterprises are generally located in midsize and smaller markets. These markets were more stable than major metropolitan markets during the most recent downturn in advertising spending
but may not experience increases in such spending as significant as those in major metropolitan markets in periods of economic improvement.             ONLINE ADVERTISING AND SERVICES             The Company s online activities include websites supporting each of its daily newspapers and certain of its other publications. Internet activities of the newspapers, except for TNI and MNI, are reported and managed as a
part of the Company s publishing operations.            In November 2006, the Company, in
conjunction with seven other major publishing organizations, announced a strategic alliance with Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), whereby the publishing consortium will offer its classified employment advertising customer base the opportunity to also post job
listings on Yahoo s HotJobs national platform. In addition, the consortium and Yahoo plan to work together to provide new search, content and local applications across the newspapers  online sites, further enhancing the value of these
sites as a destination for online users.            The Company also owns 83% of an Internet
service company, INN Partners, L.C. (doing business as TownNews.com) that provides online infrastructure for more than 1,500 daily and weekly newspapers and shoppers. In addition, the Company has minority investments in two online service companies,
which provide integrated online classified solutions for the newspaper industry, integrate online editorial content and provide transactional and promotional opportunities.            Online businesses of the Company have experienced rapid growth over the last several years, which is expected to continue. Online advertising
represented 4.7% of total advertising revenue in September

2006, an increase from 3.3% in September 2005. Page views increased 45.4% between September 2005 and September 2006.             READERSHIP AND CIRCULATION             Based on independent research, the Company estimates that, on an average Sunday, its newspapers are read by up to 75% of adults in its markets. In the
St. Louis market, Scarborough Research estimates the  St. Louis Post Dispatch  and STLToday.com reach 63% of adults. The Company s extensive array of suburban newspapers and other publications further increases reach in St. Louis.
Readership by young adults is also significant in the Company s markets as summarized in the table below. The Company is reaching an increasingly larger share of the market through rapid online growth, as illustrated in the table below, as well
as through additional specialty and niche publications.

  Billings, Bloomington, Sioux City, Waterloo              After advertising, circulation is the Company s largest source of revenue. According to national  Editor   Publisher  data, daily newspaper circulation unit sales
have decreased 15% cumulatively through 2005 since their peak in 1985 and Sunday circulation unit sales have decreased 12% since their peak in 1990. The number of daily newspapers declined 13% from 1985 to 2005. For the six months ended September
2006, daily circulation, which includes Pulitzer, TNI and MNI, as measured by the Audit Bureau of Circulations (ABC), declined 0.2%, and Sunday circulation declined 0.5%, significantly outperforming the industry as a whole. The charts on page 6
depict the percentage change in daily and Sunday circulation unit sales of the Company s newspapers over the last five years, compared to the corresponding six month period of the previous year. Such results are, in substantially all reporting
periods, better than industry averages.            Growth in readership and circulation, as well as
growth in online visitors, can, over time, also positively impact advertising revenue. The Company s strategies to improve readership and circulation, as well as website visits, include continuous improvement of content and promotional efforts.
Content can include focus on local news, features, scope of coverage, headline accuracy, presentation, writing style, tone, type style and reduction of factual errors. Promotional efforts include advertising, contests and other initiatives to
increase awareness of the products. Customer service can also influence circulation. The Company s enterprises are also focused on increasing the number of subscribers who pay for their subscriptions via automated payment mechanisms, such as
credit cards or checking account withdrawals. Customers using these payment methods have historically higher retention. Other initiatives vary from location to location and are determined principally by the publishers at the local level in
collaboration with senior management of the Company. Competition for circulation is generally based on the content, journalistic quality and price of the publication.

Table of Contents  

Circulation competition exists in all markets, even from
unpaid products, but is most significant in markets with competing daily newspapers. These markets tend to be near major metropolitan areas, where the size of the population is sufficient to support more than one daily newspaper.           

            Changes in telemarketing regulations first effective in 2004
reduced the Company s ability to obtain new subscribers using this channel. Other methods to attract and retain subscribers have been and remain in use. However, telemarketing has historically been the largest single source of new subscribers.
Same property circulation starts obtained through the Company s marketing efforts increased more than 10% in 2004, in spite of new telemarketing restrictions, but declined 2% in 2006 and 2005.            In 2004, several major newspaper publishers (not including the Company) announced significant downward
adjustments to previously reported circulation totals. The Company did not experience any impact on its relationships with advertisers from such announcements by other publishers. Approximately 75% of the Company s circulation is home delivery.
Combined with small route sizes and the limited use of independent distributors, monitoring and inspection of the Company s circulation is not as difficult as in some major metropolitan markets. Nonetheless, in 2004 the Company enhanced its
existing procedures in several areas to further ensure the integrity of its reported circulation.

  Owned by MNI, which is 50% owned by the Company.              Certain of the Company s newspapers also directly provide commercial printing services. Commercial printing business is highly competitive and generally has lower operating
margins than newspapers.             NEWSPRINT             The basic raw material of newspapers, and classified and specialty publications, is newsprint. The
Company and its subsidiaries purchase newsprint from U.S. and Canadian producers. The Company believes it will continue to receive a supply of newsprint adequate for its needs and considers its relationships with newsprint producers to be good.
Newsprint prices are volatile and fluctuate based upon factors that include both foreign and domestic production capacity and consumption. Between September 2005 and September 2006, the Resource Information Systems, Inc. 30 pound newsprint price
index rose 7.8%. Price fluctuations can have a significant effect on the results of operations. The Company has not entered into derivative contracts for newsprint. For additional information regarding supply of newsprint, see  Contractual
Obligations  under Item 7, included herein. For the quantitative impacts of these fluctuations, see  Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  under Item 7A, included herein.

         In addition, the Company s revenue, including
same property results, is reported to the public on a monthly basis, as is certain other statistical information, improving the timeliness of reporting of information to investors. The Company was also among the first to voluntarily record expense
related to employee stock options.            At  www.lee.net , one may access a wide variety
of information, including news releases, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, financial statistics, annual reports, presentations, governance documents, newspaper profiles and online links. The Company makes available via its website, all
filings made by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and related amendments, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. All such filings are available
free of charge. The content of any website referred to in this Form 10-K is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K unless expressly noted.             OTHER MATTERS             In the opinion of management, compliance with present statutory and regulatory requirements respecting environmental quality will not necessitate significant capital outlays, materially affect the earning power of the business of the
Company, or cause material changes in the Company s business, whether present or intended.             
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS             Risk exists that the Company s past results may not be indicative of future results. A discussion of certain of the more significant of these risks follows. See also,  Forward-Looking Statements  on page 1, included herein.
            OPERATING REVENUE             Advertising revenue in certain categories, or all categories, may decrease in the future. For example, automotive classified advertising revenue
declined in 2006, primarily related to industry-wide issues affecting certain domestic auto manufacturers. Such decreases may not be compensated for by growth in advertising in other categories. In addition, major retail store chains have
experienced significant merger and acquisition activity over the last several years, effectively reducing the number of brand names under which the merged entities operate. Such reductions may negatively impact future amounts of advertising revenue
generated by the Company.            Circulation unit sales have been declining fractionally for
several years. To date, declines in circulation unit sales have not substantially mitigated the Company s ability to implement price increases for its products. However, the possibility exists that future price increases may be delayed or
reduced as a result of future declines in circulation unit sales. The Company is reaching an increasingly larger share of the market through rapid online growth, as well as through additional specialty and niche publications.            See Item 1,  Advertising , included herein, for additional information on the risks
associated with advertising revenue.             OPERATING EXPENSES             Newsprint comprises a significant amount of the Company s operating costs. See Item 1,
 Newsprint  and Item 7A,  Commodities , included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with newsprint costs.             INTEREST EXPENSE             The Company has substantial debt, the majority of which is subject to changes in market interest rates. See Item 7A,  Interest Rates , included herein, for additional information on the risks associated with floating rate
debt.

  ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES             The Company s
executive offices are located in leased facilities at 201 North Harrison Street, Suite 600, Davenport, Iowa. The lease expires in 2019.            All of the Company s principal printing facilities (except Madison, Wisconsin, which is owned by MNI, Tucson, which is jointly owned by Star Publishing and Citizen, and leased
land for the Helena, Montana and Lihue, Hawaii plants) are owned. All facilities are well maintained, in good condition, suitable for existing office and publishing operations and adequately equipped. With the exception of St. Louis, none of the
Company s facilities is individually significant to its business.            Information
related to St. Louis facilities at September 30, 2006 is as follows:         
          The  Baraboo News Republic, Beatrice Daily
Sun, Corvallis Gazette-Times, Daily Citizen, Journal Gazette, The Lompoc Record, Muscatine Journal, Ravalli Republic, Times Courier  and  Winona Daily News,  as well as many of the Company s and MNI s more than 300 other
publications, are printed at other Company facilities to enhance operating efficiency. The Company s newspapers and other publications have formal or informal backup arrangements for printing in the event of a disruption in production
capability.             
  ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS             The Company is
involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. Insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for certain of these matters. While the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions, it is
the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole.             
  ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS             No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2006.

  ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT S COMMON STOCK        AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS    
        Common Stock of the Company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Class B Common Stock is not
traded on an exchange but is readily convertible to Common Stock. Class B Common Stock was issued to stockholders of record of the Company in 1986 pursuant to a 100% stock dividend and is converted at sale, or at the option of the holder, into
Common Stock. The table below includes the high and low prices of Common Stock for each quarter during the past three years, the closing price at the end of each quarter and dividends per common share.         
          Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have
identical rights with respect to cash dividends and upon liquidation. For a more complete description of the relative rights of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.
           At September 30, 2006, the Company had 7,172 holders of Common Stock, including
participants in the Company s employee stock purchase plans, and 1,485 holders of Class B Common Stock.            During the three months ended September 30, 2006, the Company purchased shares of Common Stock, as noted in the table below, in transactions with participants in its 1990 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The transactions resulted
from the withholding of shares to fund the exercise price and/or taxes related to the exercise of stock options. The Company is not currently engaged in share repurchases related to a publicly announced plan or program.         
          On November 15, 2006, the Board of Directors
declared a dividend in the amount of $0.18 per share on the issued and outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock of the Company, to be paid on January 2, 2007, to stockholders of record on December 1, 2006.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF        FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
            The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to the
Company s results of operations and financial condition as of, and for the three years ended, September 2006. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, included herein.
            NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES              Operating Cash Flow and Operating Cash Flow Margin             Operating cash flow, which is defined as operating income before depreciation, amortization, and equity
in earnings of associated companies, and operating cash flow margin (operating cash flow divided by operating revenue) represent non-GAAP financial measures that are used in the analysis below. The Company believes that operating cash flow and the
related margin percentage are useful measures of evaluating its financial performance because of their focus on the Company s results from operations before depreciation and amortization. The Company also believes that these measures are
several of the alternative financial measures of performance used by investors, lenders, rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a company and evaluate its ability to meet debt service requirements.            A reconciliation of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income, the most
directly comparable measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), is included in the table below:         
           Adjusted Income From
Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings Per Common Share             The Company believes
the use of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per common share provide meaningful supplemental information to investors and financial analysts with which to evaluate its financial
performance by excluding expenses that may not be indicative of its core business operating results and are of a substantially non-recurring nature. The Company also believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these
non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company s performance and in forecasting and analyzing future periods that are not likely to include the adjusted items. References to these non-GAAP measures should not, however, be considered a
substitute for net income and earnings per common share presented in accordance with GAAP.             SAME PROPERTY COMPARISONS             Certain information below, as noted, is
presented on a same property basis, which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures consummated in the current or prior year. The Company believes such comparisons provide meaningful information for an understanding of changes in its revenue and
operating expenses. Same property comparisons exclude MNI. The Company owns 50% of the capital stock of MNI, which for financial reporting purposes is reported using the equity method of accounting. Same property comparisons also exclude corporate
office costs.             CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES             The Company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are
based upon the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with  
       
   16   

Table of Contents  

GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of the Company s accounting policies.             Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets             In assessing the recoverability of its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets, the Company makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to
determine the fair value of the respective assets. The Company analyzes its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. See Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for a more detailed explanation of the Company s intangible assets.            The Company also periodically evaluates its determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets. Any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets
will not impact the cash flows of the Company. However, a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share.             Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans             The Company evaluates its liability for pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based
upon computations made by consulting actuaries, incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs, future interest costs on projected benefit obligations, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates,
anticipated mortality rates, expected investment returns on plan assets, asset allocation assumptions of plan assets, and other factors. If the Company used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans
could vary significantly, resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods.             Income Taxes             Deferred income taxes are
provided using the liability method, whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary
differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.            The Company files income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and various state tax
jurisdictions. From time to time, the Company is subject to routine audits by those agencies, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. The Company has considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing
agencies, believes its positions taken regarding its filings are valid, and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters.             Revenue Recognition             Advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related online site. Circulation revenue is recorded as newspapers are distributed over the subscription term. Other revenue is
recognized when the related product or service has been delivered. Unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for newspapers or advance payments for advertising.

          Uninsured Risks             The Company is self-insured for health care, workers compensation and certain long-term disability
costs of its employees, subject to stop loss insurance, which limits exposure to large claims. The Company accrues its estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred, including an estimate of incurred but not reported
claims. Other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts.            The
Company s reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries. The amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon
historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry.             IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS             In October 2005 the
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement 123-Revised,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  (Statement 123R) and related FASB staff positions. Statement 123R amends Statement 95,  Statement of Cash Flows ,
to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid.            Statement 123R also establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services (primarily accounting
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions, such as stock options). Statement 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an equity instrument
based on the grant date fair value of the award. In general, the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the award (usually the vesting period). The fair value based methods
in Statement 123R are similar to the fair value based method in Statement 123 in most respects. The Company adopted Statement 123 in 2003.            In October 2005 the Company adopted FASB Statement 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets . This pronouncement amends APB Opinion 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary
Transactions . Statement 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets present in APB Opinion 29 and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance (i.e. transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reported entity).            In October 2005 the Company adopted FASB Interpretation 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . Interpretation 47 requires an entity to recognize a
liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of the settlement are conditional on a future event. The liability must be recognized if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably
estimated.            The adoption of the statements and interpretation discussed above did not
have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.            In May 2005 the FASB issued Statement 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections   a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3,  that changes the requirements for the accounting and
reporting of a change in accounting principle. Statement 154 eliminates the requirement to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in the current period of change and instead, requires that changes in accounting principle
be retrospectively applied. Statement 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not anticipate that the implementation of Statement 154 will have a material impact on its
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.            In July 2006, the FASB issued
Interpretation 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Interpretation 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement 109. Interpretation 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure,  
       
   18   

Table of Contents  

present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company has not completed
its evaluation of the effects of Interpretation 48 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.            In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 157,  Fair Value Measurements , which defines fair value, provides guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements. Statement 157 does not require any new fair value
measurement but applies to the accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement. Statement 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not anticipate that the implementation of
Statement 157 will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation, or cash flows.            In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 158,  Employer s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , which amends statements 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Statement 158 requires the
recognition of the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive
income. Statement 158 is effective at the end of 2007. Had Statement 158 been adopted at September 30, 2006, the Company s assets would have increased and liabilities would have decreased in the aggregate amount of $44,191,000, less the related
income tax effect, and stockholders  equity would have increased by $44,191,000, less the related income tax effect. Actual adjustments have not been determined as the related actuarial computations have not been performed.            Statement 158 will also require the Company to change its measurement date from June 30 to September
30, beginning in 2008. The change in measurement date will require a one-time adjustment to retained earnings, the effect of which cannot be determined at this time. None of the changes required will impact the Company s results of operations
or cash flows.

          CONTINUING OPERATIONS              2006 vs. 2005             Operating results, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, are summarized below:         
          Sundays generate substantially more advertising
and circulation revenue than any other day of the week. 2006 had the same number of Sundays as 2005.            In June 2005, the Company acquired Pulitzer. Pulitzer published fourteen daily newspapers (the smallest of which was sold in 2006), including the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch,  and more than 100 weekly newspapers and specialty
publications. Pulitzer also owns a 50% interest in TNI. The acquisition of Pulitzer increased the Company s circulation by more than 50% and revenue by more than 60%.            In total, acquisitions and divestitures accounted for $450,341,000 of operating revenue in 2006 and $147,643,000 of operating revenue in 2005.

          Advertising Revenue             In 2006, total advertising revenue increased $250,459,000, or 40.1%, and same property advertising
revenue increased $8,559,000, or 1.7%. Same property retail revenue increased $1,431,000, or 0.5%, in 2006. Continuing emphasis on rate discipline offset by a 1.0% decrease in retail advertising lineage contributed to the increase. Same property
average retail rates, excluding preprint insertions, increased 1.2% in 2006. Rate discipline means adhering to standard rates rather than negotiating specific rates for individual customer situations.            Same property classified advertising revenue increased $1,907,000, or 1.1%, in 2006. Higher rate
employment advertising at the daily newspapers increased 7.1% for the year on a same property basis. The Company s increases in employment classified advertising compare favorably to national survey amounts. The September 2006 Help Wanted
Index, as calculated by the Conference Board, decreased 18.9% from the prior year level. Same property average automotive advertising decreased 10.2%, due to a 3.6% decrease in average automotive rates and a 6.8% decrease in lineage. Same property
real estate advertising increased 1.3% due to an increase in advertising of real estate for sale. Other daily newspaper classified advertising increased 1.8% on a same property basis. Same property classified advertising rates increased 1.1%,
primarily due to an increase in employment rates offset by declines in automotive rates.            Advertising lineage, as reported on a same property basis for the Company s daily newspapers only, consists of the following:         
          Online advertising revenue increased 43.1% on a
same property basis, due to rate increases, expanded use of the Company s online business model and cross-selling with the Company s print publications. Online classified advertising registered particularly strong growth. Advertising in
niche publications increased 8.2% on a same property basis, due to new publications in existing markets and penetration of new and existing markets, offset by the loss of one significant publication in a larger market.             Circulation and Other Revenue             Circulation revenue increased $52,147,000, or 34.0% in 2006, and same property circulation revenue decreased $1,230,000, or 1.0%. The Company s
total average daily newspaper circulation units, including Pulitzer, TNI and MNI, as measured by the ABC, declined 0.2% for the six months ended September 2006, compared to the same period in the prior year, and Sunday circulation declined 0.5%,
significantly outperforming the industry as a whole. For the six months ended March 2006, total average daily circulation units, including Pulitzer, TNI and MNI, declined 0.6% and Sunday circulation decreased 1.0%, again outperforming the industry.
In spite of modest declines in circulation, the Company is reaching an increasingly larger share of the market through rapid online growth, as well as through additional specialty and niche publications.            Same property commercial printing revenue increased $45,000, or 0.3%, in 2006. Same property online
services and other revenue decreased $314,000, or 1.3%, in 2006.             Operating Expenses
and Results of Operations             Costs other than depreciation and amortization increased
$235,177,000, or 38.3%, in 2006, and increased $17,728,000, or 3.9%, on a same property basis. In total, acquisitions and divestitures accounted for $345,467,000 of operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, in 2006 and
$155,404,000 in 2005.

         Compensation expense increased $109,877,000, or 33.7%,
in 2006 due to costs of acquired businesses and a 1.8% increase in same property compensation expense. Normal salary adjustments and associated increases in payroll taxes and benefits account for the increase in same property costs. Same property
full time equivalent employees declined 0.4% in 2006 from the prior year level.            Newsprint and ink costs increased $40,860,000, or 51.5%, in 2006 due to price increases and costs of acquired businesses, and increased 8.7% on a same property basis. Volume decreased 2.0% on a same property basis, due to migration to
lighter weight paper and narrower page widths. Newsprint unit costs had been rising since late 2002 and, though prices now appear to be stabilizing, additional increases may negatively impact 2007 results.            Other operating costs, which are comprised of all operating expenses not considered to be compensation,
newsprint, depreciation and amortization, increased $89,250,000, or 46.8%, in 2006 and increased 5.5% on a same property basis. Costs associated with new niche publications and expenses to increase circulation using sources other than telemarketing
also contributed to the growth in costs. Changes in telemarketing regulations enacted in 2004 will continue to impact the Company s ability to solicit new subscribers, and the cost of such solicitation, in the future.            In 2006, the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  concluded an offering of early retirement incentives that
resulted in an adjustment of staffing levels. 130 employees volunteered to take advantage of the offer, which included enhanced pension and insurance benefits, and lump-sum cash payments based on continuous service. The annual pretax savings from
the program, net of positions filled, is estimated to be $6,600,000 to $7,000,000, with savings of $6,575,000 in 2006. The cost totaled $17,778,000 before income tax benefit, with $8,654,000 recognized in 2006, and $9,124,000 in 2005. Approximately
$7,000,000 of the cost represents cash payments made, with the remainder due primarily to enhancements of pension and other postretirement benefits.            Transition costs related to the acquisition of Pulitzer, which are not included in same property comparisons, totaled $4,589,000 in 2006 and $8,929,000 in 2005. Transition costs
are comprised of costs directly related to the acquisition of Pulitzer that are separately identifiable and non-recurring, but not capitalizable under GAAP.            Operating cash flow increased 36.4% to $279,360,000 in 2006 from $204,779,000 in 2005, and decreased 5.0% on a same property basis. Operating cash flow margin decreased to 24.8%
from 25.0% in the prior year reflecting the overall lower margin of the Pulitzer newspapers, transition costs related to the Pulitzer acquisition and the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  early retirement program.            Depreciation expense increased $10,149,000, or 42.7%, and amortization expense increased $26,672,000,
or 75.1%, in 2006, due primarily to the acquisition of Pulitzer.            In 2006, the
Company, based on its most recent analysis and in conjunction with its ongoing requirement to assess the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, concluded that the period of economic benefit of certain identified
intangible assets related to the Pulitzer acquisition had decreased. As a result, the weighted-average useful life of customer lists was decreased from approximately 21 years to 17 years.            The change in estimated useful life of such assets resulted in recognition of additional amortization
expense of $1,847,000 in the last four months of 2006, of which $469,000 is recorded in equity in earnings of TNI. The Company expects amortization to increase by approximately $5,544,000 in 2007 solely as a result of the change in useful life.
$1,408,000 of this amount will reduce equity in earnings of TNI. This change in non-cash amortization expense has no impact on the Company s cash flows or debt covenants.            In 2006, the Company also recorded a separate non-cash charge of $5,526,000 to reduce the value of nonamortized masthead intangible assets of
Pulitzer, of which $4,939,000 is recorded in amortization expense and $587,000 is recorded in equity in earnings of TNI.            Equity in earnings in associated companies increased 62.2% in 2006 due to the inclusion of TNI for the full year, offset by a decrease in earnings of MNI. MNI results were reduced
by the $1,002,000 loss on

sale of its Shawano, Wisconsin daily newspaper. Operating income increased $45,715,000, or 28.9%. Operating income margin decreased to 18.1% in 2006 from 19.3% due to
the inclusion of Pulitzer results, early retirement and transition costs and the reduction in value of intangible assets noted above.             Non-Operating Income and Expense             Financial expense increased $57,901,000, or 152.2%, to $95,939,000 due to the full year effect of increased debt and associated financing costs as a result of the Pulitzer acquisition and higher interest rates, partially offset
by substantial debt reduction of $163,000,000 funded by cash generated from operations and sales of assets. In 2006 the Company wrote off certain other investments which resulted in a loss before income taxes of $2,037,000. In 2005, the Company
refinanced its then existing debt as a result of the Pulitzer acquisition, which resulted in a one-time pretax loss from early extinguishment of debt of $11,181,000.             Overall Results             Income taxes were 35.4% of income from continuing operations before income taxes in 2006 and 36.3% in 2005. The Company believes, absent unusual tax settlements, that its effective
income tax rate in 2007 will approximate the rate in 2006.            As a result of all of the
above, income from continuing operations totaled $71,136,000 in 2006, an increase of 0.4% compared to $70,862,000 in 2005. Earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations were $1.56 in both 2006 and 2005. Excluding unusual costs, as
detailed in the table below, diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, were $1.84 in 2006, compared to $1.96 in 2005.

          CONTINUING OPERATIONS              2005 vs. 2004             Operating results, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, are summarized below:         
          Sundays generate substantially more advertising
and circulation revenue than any other day of the week. 2005 had the same number of Sundays as 2004.            In June 2005, the Company acquired Pulitzer. Pulitzer published fourteen daily newspapers (the smallest of which is classified in discontinued operations due to its sale in 2006), including the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 
and more than 100 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also owns a 50% interest in TNI. The acquisition of Pulitzer increased the Company s circulation by more than 50% and revenue, on an annualized basis, by more than 60%.

         In total, acquisitions and divestitures accounted for
$160,606,000 of operating revenue in 2005 and $7,912,000 in 2004.             Advertising Revenue
            In 2005, total advertising revenue increased $149,236,000, or 31.4%, and same
property advertising revenue increased $23,639,000, or 5.0%. Same property retail revenue increased $9,109,000, or 3.4%, in 2005. Continuing emphasis on rate discipline and an increase in active accounts, offset by a 1.8% decrease in advertising
lineage, contributed to the increase. Same property average retail rates, excluding preprint insertions, increased 4.1% in 2005.            Same property classified advertising revenue increased $8,791,000, or 5.5%, in 2005. Higher rate employment advertising at the daily newspapers increased 16.0% for the year on a
same property basis. The Company s increases in employment classified advertising compare favorably to national survey amounts. The September 2005 Help Wanted Index, as calculated by the Conference Board, increased 8.3% from the prior year
level. Same property average automotive advertising decreased 4.3%, due to a 5.1% decrease in average automotive rates, offset by a 0.8% increase in lineage. Same property real estate advertising increased 8.1% due to an increase in advertising of
real estate for sale. Other daily newspaper classified advertising decreased 0.4% on a same property basis. Same property classified advertising rates decreased 1.5%, primarily due to the decline in automotive rates.            Advertising lineage, as reported on a same property basis for the Company s daily newspapers only,
consists of the following:         
          Online advertising revenue increased 33.4% on a
same property basis, due to expanded use of the Company s online business model and cross-selling with the Company s print publications. Online classified advertising registered particularly strong growth. Advertising in niche publications
increased 1.1% on a same property basis, due to new publications in existing markets and penetration of new and existing markets, offset by the loss of one significant publication in a larger market.             Circulation and Other Revenue             Circulation revenue increased $23,548,000, or 18.1% in 2005, and same property circulation revenue decreased $2,819,000, or 2.2%. The Company s
total average daily newspaper circulation units, including Pulitzer, TNI and MNI, as measured by the ABC, declined 2.2% for the six months ended September 2005, compared to the same period in the prior year, and Sunday circulation declined 2.3%,
significantly outperforming the industry as a whole. For the six months ended March 2005, total average daily circulation units, including MNI, declined 1.7% and Sunday circulation decreased 1.9%, again outperforming the industry.            Same property commercial printing revenue decreased $107,000, or 0.8%, in 2005. Same property online
services and other revenue increased $2,205,000, or 9.8%, in 2005.             Operating Expenses
and Results of Operations             Costs other than depreciation and amortization increased
$147,245,000, or 31.5%, in 2005, and increased $11,645,000, or 2.7%, on a same property basis. In total, acquisitions and divestitures accounted for $133,757,000 of operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, in 2005 and $6,782,000
in 2004.

         Compensation expense increased $65,132,000, or 25.0%,
in 2005 due to costs of acquired businesses and a 2.3% increase in same property compensation expense. Normal salary adjustments and associated increases in payroll taxes and benefits account for the increase in same property costs. Same property
full time equivalent employees declined 0.4% in 2005 from the prior year level.            Newsprint and ink costs increased $21,178,000, or 36.4%, in 2005 due to price increases and costs of acquired businesses, and increased 8.0% on a same property basis. Volume decreased 0.1% on a same property basis.            Other operating costs, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $42,882,000, or 29.0%, in
2005 and increased 1.2% on a same property basis. Transition costs related to the acquisition of Pulitzer, which are not included in same property comparisons, totaled $8,929,000 in 2005. Early retirement program costs totaled $9,124,000 in 2005.
           Operating cash flow increased 16.1% to $204,779,000 in 2005 from $176,411,000 in 2004,
and increased 5.6% on a same property basis. Operating cash flow margin decreased to 25.0% from 27.4% in the prior year reflecting the overall lower margin of the Pulitzer newspapers, transition costs and the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  early
retirement program.            Depreciation expense increased $4,613,000, or 24.1%, and
amortization expense increased $10,706,000, or 43.2%, in 2005, due primarily to the acquisition of Pulitzer. Equity in earnings in associated companies increased 50.0% in 2005 due to increasing earnings of MNI and the inclusion of TNI. Operating
income increased $17,310,000, or 12.3%. Operating income margin decreased to 19.3% in 2005 from 21.9% due to the inclusion of Pulitzer results and early retirement and transition costs noted above.             Non-Operating Income and Expense             Financial expense increased $25,373,000, or 200.3%, to $38,038,000 due to increased debt and associated financing costs as a result of the Pulitzer
acquisition and higher interest rates, partially offset by debt reduction funded by cash generated from operations. In 2005, the Company refinanced its then existing debt as a result of the Pulitzer acquisition, which resulted in a one-time pretax
loss from early extinguishment of debt of $11,181,000.             Overall Results
            Income taxes were 36.3% of income from continuing operations before income taxes in
2005 and 35.6% in 2004. The favorable resolution of tax issues reduced income tax expense by approximately $1,200,000 in 2004. The effective rate would have been 36.6% in 2004 without this event.            As a result of all of the above, income from continuing operations totaled $70,862,000 in 2005, a
decrease of 14.6% compared to $82,973,000 in 2004. Earnings per diluted common share decreased 15.2% to $1.56 in 2005 from $1.84 in 2004. Excluding unusual costs, as detailed in the table below, diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, were

          DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS             Revenue from discontinued operations in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $41,104,000 $42,297,000 and
$43,477,000, respectively. Income from discontinued operations before income taxes was $7,803,000 in 2006, $9,911,000 in 2005 and $5,454,000 in 2004.            In September 2006, the Company sold several stand-alone publishing and commercial printing operations in the Pacific Northwest, a twice-weekly newspaper in Oregon, and a daily
newspaper in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The transactions resulted in an after tax loss of $5,204,000, which is recorded in discontinued operations in 2006. Proceeds from the sales totaled $54,148,000 of which $33,198,000 was received in 2006.
           In February 2004, the Company exchanged its daily newspapers in Freeport, Illinois and
Corning, New York for two daily newspapers and eight weekly and specialty publications in Nevada and Idaho. The transaction resulted in an after tax loss of $228,000, which is recorded in discontinued operations in 2004.             LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES             Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $197,161,000 in 2006, $151,686,000 in 2005 and $121,709,000 in 2004. Decreased
income from continuing operations in 2006 and 2005 was more than offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization. Losses related to financing activities influenced 2005 results and changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for the
bulk of the remainder of the change in all years.            Cash required for investing activities
totaled $42,683,000 in 2006, $1,272,309,000 in 2005, and $27,164,000 in 2004. Capital spending totaled $32,544,000 and accounted for substantially all of the usage of funds in 2006. Pulitzer and other acquisitions accounted for substantially all of
the usage of funds in 2005 offset by proceeds from sales of securities. Capital spending and acquisitions accounted for substantially all of the usage of funds in 2004.            The Company anticipates that funds necessary for capital expenditures, which are expected to total approximately $32,000,000 in 2007, and other
requirements, will be available from internally generated funds, availability under its existing Credit Agreement or, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets.            In 2006, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of financial institutions. The
Credit Agreement provides for aggregate borrowing of up to $1,435,000,000 and consists of a $950,000,000 A Term Loan, $35,000,000 B Term Loan and $450,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement also provides the Company with the right,
with the consent of the administrative agent, to request at certain times prior to June 2012 that one or more lenders provide incremental term loan commitments of up to $500,000,000, subject to certain requirements being satisfied at the time of the
request. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2012 and amends and replaces a $1,550,000,000 credit agreement (the Old Credit Agreement) consummated in 2005. Interest rate margins under the Credit Agreement are generally lower than under the Old
Credit Agreement. Other conditions of the Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the Old Credit Agreement.            The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financing of its type. These financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio (5.75:1 at
September 30, 2006) and minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 2.5:1. None of the covenants included in the Credit Agreement is considered by the Company to be restrictive to normal operations or historical amounts of stockholder dividends.
At September 30, 2006, the Company is in compliance with such covenants.            The Credit
Agreement requires the Company to apply the net proceeds from asset sales to repayment of the A Term Loan to the extent such proceeds exceed the amount used to purchase assets (other than inventory and working capital) within one year of the asset
sales. The Company expects repayments in 2007 to meet or exceed required repayments related to its 2006 sales transactions.

         In 2005, upon consummation of the Old Credit
Agreement, the Company borrowed $1,462,000,000. The proceeds were used to consummate the acquisition of Pulitzer, to repay existing indebtedness of the Company, as discussed more fully below, and to pay related fees and expenses.            In connection with the execution of the Old Credit Agreement, the Company redeemed all of the
$52,000,000 outstanding indebtedness under its then existing credit agreement and the existing senior notes of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 18, 1998 totaling $102,000,000. Refinancing of existing debt of the
Company resulted in a pretax loss of $11,181,000.            In 2005, the Company executed interest
rate swaps in the notional amount of $350,000,000 with a forward starting date of November 30, 2005. The interest rate swaps have terms of 2 to 5 years, carry interest rates from 4.2% to 4.4% (plus the applicable LIBOR margin) and effectively
fix the Company s interest rate on debt in the amount, and for the time periods, of such instruments.            In 2005, the Company filed a Form S-3 shelf registration statement (Shelf) with the SEC, which has been declared effective. The Shelf gives the Company the flexibility to issue and publicly distribute various types of
securities, including preferred stock, common stock, secured or unsecured debt securities, purchase contracts and units consisting of any combination of such securities, from time to time, in one or more offerings, up to an aggregate amount of
$500,000,000.            The Shelf enables the Company to sell securities quickly and efficiently
when market conditions are favorable or financing needs arise. Net proceeds from the sale of any securities may be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of debt, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
or the repurchase of common stock, subject to conditions of existing debt agreements.            Cash required by financing activities totaled $191,930,000 in 2006, provided $1,112,035,000 during 2005, and required $105,854,000 in 2004. Debt reduction and dividends accounted for the majority of the usage of funds in 2006 and 2004. Cash
dividend payments in 2004 were influenced primarily by timing. The annual dividend was $0.72 per share in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Borrowing to fund the Pulitzer acquisition and refinance existing debt accounted for substantially all of the funds
provided in 2005.            Cash provided by discontinued operations totaled $38,547,000,
$8,121,000 and $8,255,000 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash proceeds from the sales of discontinued operations and cash generated from operations were the primary sources of funds in 2006. Cash generated from operations was the primary
source of funds in 2005. Cash generated from operations offset by tax payments related to nondeductible goodwill and basis differences in identified intangible assets associated with the exchange of the Company s daily newspapers in Corning,
New York and Freeport, Illinois in February 2004, offset by changes in working capital of sold properties was the primary source of funds in 2004.            Cash and cash equivalents increased $1,095,000 in 2006, and decreased $467,000 in 2005 and $3,054,000 in 2004.             SEASONALITY             The Company s largest source of publishing revenue, retail advertising, is seasonal and tends to fluctuate with retail sales in markets served. Historically, retail
advertising is higher in the first and third fiscal quarters. Advertising revenue is lowest in the second fiscal quarter.            Quarterly results of operations are summarized in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.             INFLATION             The Company has not been significantly impacted by general inflationary pressures over the last several years. The Company anticipates that changing costs of newsprint, its basic
raw material, may impact future operating costs. Price increases (or decreases) for the Company s products are implemented when deemed appropriate by management. The Company continuously evaluates price increases, productivity improvements,
sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation.

          CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS             The following table summarizes the more significant of the Company s contractual obligations.

(1)  
  Financial expense excludes interest on floating rate debt. Based on interest rates and floating rate debt at September 30, 2006, including debt subject to interest rate swaps described
below, annual interest on floating rate debt is approximately $72,000,000.              The table above excludes future cash requirements for pension, postretirement and postemployment obligations. The periods in which these obligations will be settled in cash are not readily determinable and are subject to numerous future
events and assumptions. The Company s estimate of cash requirements for these obligations in 2007 is approximately $3,130,000.            A substantial amount of the Company s deferred income tax liabilities is related to acquisitions and will not result in future cash payments. See Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein.             
  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK             The Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, exposure to
certain of these market risks is managed as described below.             INTEREST RATES
             Restricted Cash and Investments             Interest rate risk in the Company s restricted cash and investments is managed by investing only
in securities with maturities no later than May 2010, after which time all restrictions on such funds lapse. Only U.S. Government and related securities are permitted.             Debt             The Company s debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt. The Company s primary exposure is to the London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR). A 100 basis point increase to LIBOR would decrease income from continuing operations before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately $8,690,000, based on floating rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2006,
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below, and excluding debt of MNI. Such interest rates may also decrease.            In 2005, the Company executed interest rate swaps in the notional amount of $350,000,000 with a forward starting date of November 30, 2005. The interest rate swaps have terms
of 2 to 5 years, carry interest rates from 4.2% to 4.4% (plus the applicable LIBOR margin) and effectively fix the Company s interest rate on debt in the amounts, and for the time periods, of such instruments. Interest-earning assets, including
those in employee benefit plans, also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt.         
   29   

Table of Contents  

         At September 30, 2006, after consideration of the
interest rate swaps described above, approximately 57% of the principal amount of the Company s debt is subject to floating interest rates.             COMMODITIES             Certain materials used by the Company are exposed to commodity price changes. The Company manages this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non-cancelable supply contracts. The Company is also involved in continuing programs
to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies. Primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and, to a lesser extent, ink and energy costs.            A $10 per metric ton newsprint price increase would result in an annualized reduction in income from
continuing operations before income taxes of approximately $1,730,200 based on expected consumption in 2007, excluding consumption of MNI and TNI. Such prices may also decrease.             SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN VALUE             The estimate that follows is intended to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt of the Company in one year from adverse changes in market interest
rates under normal market conditions. The calculation is not intended to represent the actual loss in fair value that the Company expects to incur. The estimate does not consider favorable changes in market rates. The position included in the
calculation is fixed rate debt, the principal amount of which totals $306,000,000 at September 30, 2006.            The estimated maximum potential one-year loss in fair value from a 100 basis point movement in interest rates on market risk sensitive investment instruments outstanding at September 30, 2006, is approximately $7,368,000.
There is no impact on reported results from such changes in interest rates.            Changes in
the value of interest rate swaps from movements in interest rates are not determinable, due to the number of variables involved in the pricing of such instruments. However, increases in interest rates would generally result in increases in the fair
value of such instruments.

  ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES             In order
to ensure that the information that must be disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, the Company has disclosure controls and procedures in place. The
Company s chief executive officer, Mary E. Junck, and chief financial officer, Carl G. Schmidt, have reviewed and evaluated disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2006, and have concluded that such controls and procedures
are effective.            There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting
that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect such controls, during the year ended September 30, 2006.

          MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING             The management of Lee Enterprises, Incorporated (the Company) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the
Company s Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.            Any internal control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, even those systems determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.            Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework . Based on the assessment and those criteria, we believe that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006.            Deloitte   Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on management s assessment of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Their report
appears on the following page.

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM             To the Stockholders      Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries      Davenport, Iowa            We have audited management s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in
 Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.            We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.            A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and board of directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.            Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control
over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.            In our opinion, management s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated
Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.            We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2006 of the Company and our
report dated December 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.            /s/ Deloitte   Touche LLP            Davenport, Iowa      December 14, 2006

directly, and through its ownership of associated companies, publishes 56 daily newspapers in 23 states and more than 300 weekly, classified and specialty publications, along with associated and integrated online sites. The Company currently
operates in a single reporting segment, as its enterprises have similar economic characteristics, products, customers and distribution.

   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                Basis of Presentation             In June 2005, the Company acquired
Pulitzer Inc. (Pulitzer). The acquisition has a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.            The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned, except for its 50% interest in Madison Newspapers, Inc., (MNI), 83% interest in INN Partners, L.C.,
(INN), and Pulitzer s (together with another subsidiary) 95% interest in St. Louis Post-Dispatch LLC (PD LLC) and STL Distribution Services LLC (DS LLC), a distribution company serving the St. Louis market, and 50% interest in the results of
operations of TNI Partners (TNI).            Certain amounts as previously reported have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.            References to 2006, 2005,
2004 and the like mean the fiscal year ended September 30.             Accounting Estimates
            The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.             Principles of Consolidation             The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned, or
majority-owned, subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.            Investments in MNI and TNI are accounted for using the equity method and are reported at cost plus the Company s share of undistributed earnings since acquisition, less, for TNI, amortization of intangible assets.            Minority interest in earnings of PD LLC, DS LLC and INN is recognized in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.             Cash and Cash Equivalents             The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less at date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.             Accounts Receivable
            The Company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on
historical credit experience, payment trends and other economic factors. Delinquency is determined based on timing of payments in relation to billing dates. Accounts considered to be uncollectible are written off.

    Inventories             Newsprint inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined by the first-in, first-out or last-in, first-out methods. Newsprint inventories at
September 30, 2006 and 2005 are less than replacement cost by $4,556,000 and $3,731,000, respectively.            The components of newsprint inventory by cost method are as follows:         
          Other inventories consisting of ink, plates and
film are priced at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined by the first-in, first-out method.             Restricted Cash and Investments             Until May 1, 2010, PD
LLC is restricted from making distributions (except under specified circumstances), capital expenditures and member loan repayments unless it has set aside out of its cash flow a reserve equal to the product of $15,000,000 and the number of years
since May 1, 2000, but not in excess of $150,000,000 (the Reserve). PD LLC is not required to maintain the Reserve after May 1, 2010. Investments in the Reserve are limited to U.S. Government and related securities and are recorded at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of applicable income taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income. The cost basis used to determine realized gains and losses is specific identification. See Note 19.             Other Investments             Other investments primarily consist of marketable securities held in trust under a deferred compensation arrangement and investments for which no
established market exists. Marketable securities are classified as trading securities and carried at fair value with gains and losses reported in earnings. Non-marketable securities are carried at cost.             Property and Equipment             Property and equipment are carried at cost. Equipment, except for printing presses and mailroom equipment, is depreciated primarily by
declining-balance methods. The straight-line method is used for all other assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:         
          The Company capitalizes interest as a component
of the cost of constructing major facilities. At September 30, 2006, capitalized interest was not significant.            Beginning in 2006, the Company recognizes the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity, when such activity is a condition of a
future event, and the fair value of the liability can be estimated.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets             Intangible assets include covenants not to compete, consulting agreements, customer lists, newspaper subscriber lists, mastheads and other. Intangible
assets subject to amortization are being amortized as follows:         
          In assessing the recoverability of its goodwill
and other nonamortized intangible assets, the Company makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. The Company analyzes its goodwill and other nonamortized intangible
assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present.            The Company also periodically evaluates its determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets. Any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact the cash flows of the Company.
However, a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share.             Revenue Recognition             Advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related online site. Circulation revenue is recorded as newspapers are distributed over
the subscription term. Other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered. Unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for newspapers or advance payments for
advertising.             Advertising Costs             Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.             Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefit Plans             The Company evaluates its liability for pension, postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based
upon computations made by consulting actuaries, incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs, future interest costs on projected benefit obligations, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates,
anticipated mortality rates, expected investment returns on plan assets, asset allocation assumptions of plan assets, and other factors. If the Company used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans
could vary significantly, resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods.             Income Taxes             Deferred income taxes are provided using the
liability method, whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the
difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
    Interest Rate Exchange Agreements             The Company accounts for interest rate exchange agreements, which are comprised of floating-to-fixed rate interest rate swaps, as cash flow hedges.
The Company expects that the fair value of these agreements will significantly offset changes in the cash flows of the associated floating rate debt. The fair value of such instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of
applicable income tax expense or benefit.             Stock Compensation             The Company has four stock-based compensation plans. The Company accounts for grants under those plans
under the fair value expense recognition provisions of FASB Statement 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  as amended by Statement 123 Revised. The adoption of Statement 123 Revised resulted in a reclassification of
unearned compensation to additional paid-in capital. The Company amortizes as compensation expense the value of stock options and restricted Common Stock by the straight-line method over the vesting or restriction period, which is generally one to
three years.             Uninsured Risks             The Company is self-insured for health care, workers compensation and certain long-term disability
costs of its employees, subject to stop loss insurance, which limits exposure to large claims. The Company accrues its estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred, including an estimate of incurred but not reported
claims. Other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts. Letters of credit and a self-insurer bond totaling $7,495,000 at September 30, 2006 are outstanding in support of the Company s insurance program.   
        The Company s reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates
of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries. The amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry.
            Discontinued Operations             In accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets,  the operations and related losses on properties sold, or identified as held for sale, have been presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for all years presented.
Gains are recognized when realized.

   ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES               All acquisitions are accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the results of operations since the respective dates of acquisition are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.             Acquisition of Pulitzer             On June 3, 2005, the Company and LP Acquisition Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Purchaser), consummated an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) dated as of January 29, 2005 with Pulitzer. The Merger Agreement provided for the Purchaser to be merged with and into Pulitzer (the Merger), with Pulitzer as the surviving corporation. Each
share of Pulitzer s Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger was converted into the right to receive from the Company or the Purchaser in cash, without interest, an amount equal to
$64 per share. Pulitzer published fourteen daily newspapers, including the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch,  and more than 100 weekly newspapers and specialty publications. Pulitzer also owns a 50% interest in TNI. See Note 4. The Merger was
consistent with the Company s announced strategy to buy newspapers with circulation of 30,000 or more.

The Merger effected a change of control of Pulitzer. At the effective time of the Merger and as a result of the Merger,
Pulitzer became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.            The unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated income statement information for 2005 and 2004, set forth below, presents the results of operations as if the acquisition of Pulitzer had occurred at the beginning of each year and is not necessarily indicative of future
results or actual results that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of such year. Pro forma results for 2005 include $29,544,000 of early retirement, transition and debt extinguishment costs related to the
acquisition. The amounts in the table below are adjusted for the divestitures of the Pacific Northwest Properties and the daily newspaper in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, described below. Other acquisitions described below are excluded as the amounts are
not significant.         
          The $1,461,585,000 purchase price of Pulitzer,
all of which was paid in cash, included approximately $11,200,000 of fees and expenses and is allocated as follows. The purchase price includes assets and liabilities of the Rhinelander, Wisconsin daily newspaper, which was sold in 2006.   
     
          Incremental goodwill was recorded as a result of
the Company s acquisition of Pulitzer as the purchase price exceeding the fair value of tangible and identified intangible assets acquired. Such goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Future tax deductible goodwill recorded by
Pulitzer as a result of prior transactions is approximately $585,500,000.

   Acquired intangible assets consist of the following:         
          In 2006 and 2005, the Company incurred
transition costs of $4,589,000 and $8,929,000, respectively, in connection with the acquisition of Pulitzer.             Other Acquisitions             In 2004, the Company exchanged its daily
newspapers in Freeport, Illinois and Corning, New York and cash totaling $2,215,000 for daily newspapers in Burley, Idaho and Elko, Nevada and eight weekly and specialty publications. In 2004 the Company also purchased five specialty publications at
a cost of $6,694,000.            In 2005, the Company purchased two specialty publications at a
cost of $309,000, made a final working capital payment of $301,000 related to a specialty publication purchased in 2004 and exchanged an internet service provider business for a weekly newspaper. In 2005, the Company also purchased eight specialty
publications at a cost of $3,908,000 and received final working capital payments of $78,000 from purchased specialty publications. In 2005, INN purchased an Internet advertisement design business at a cost of $200,000.            In 2006, the Company purchased a web-hosting business and national advertising network at a cost of
$3,800,000 from PowerOne Media, LLC (PowerOne), in which the Company and MNI own minority interests and purchased a minority interest in INN in exchange for the forgiveness of certain notes receivable with a carrying value of $75,000. In 2006, the
Company also purchased a weekly newspaper at a cost of $412,000. These other acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.            In November 2006, the Company purchased a minority interest in an online employment application from PowerOne at a cost of $118,000.

   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS               In 2006, the Company sold several stand alone publishing and commercial printing operations in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, a twice weekly newspaper in Oregon (the Pacific Northwest Properties), and
the daily newspaper in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The Company received $33,198,000 in September 2006 and recorded a receivable of $20,700,000, which was collected in October 2006. The transactions resulted in an after tax loss of $5,204,000, which is
recorded in discontinued operations.            The 2004 exchange transaction (see Note 2) resulted
in an after tax loss of $228,000, which is recorded in discontinued operations. Tax expense of $2,812,000 recorded in results of discontinued operations in 2004 is related primarily to nondeductible goodwill and basis differences in identified
intangible assets associated with the 2004 exchange transaction. Results for the Pacific Northwest Properties, Rhinelander, Freeport and Corning are recorded in discontinued operations for all years presented.

   Summarized financial information of TNI is as follows:         
          Summarized results of TNI (2005 from the
June 3, 2005 date of acquisition) are as follows:         
          Star Publishing s 50% share of TNI
depreciation and certain general and administrative expenses associated with its share of the operation and administration of TNI are reported as operating expenses in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
These amounts totaled $2,049,000 and $672,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively.            At
September 30, 2006, the carrying value of the Company s 50% investment in TNI is $173,762,000. The difference between the Company s carrying value and its 50% share of the members  equity of TNI relates principally to goodwill of
$85,240,000, and other identified intangible assets, some of which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives through 2025, of $85,005,000. See Note 6.            In January 2007, defined pension benefits for certain TNI employees will be frozen at then current levels. As a result, TNI will recognize a
curtailment gain of approximately $2,000,000 in 2007.             Madison Newspapers, Inc.

          Proceeds from the sale of such securities total
$68,043,000 in 2006, resulting in no gross realized gains or losses, and $67,199,000 in 2005, resulting in gross realized gains of $84,000 and gross realized losses of $10,000.            The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities as of September 30, 2006, by contractual maturity, are as follows. Contractual
maturities may differ from actual maturities as borrowers may have the right to call or repay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS               Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill related to continuing operations are as follows:         

54   

Table of Contents  

Identified intangible assets related to continuing operations consist of the following:         
          In 2006, the Company, based on its most
recent analysis and in conjunction with its ongoing requirement to assess the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, concluded that the period of economic benefit of certain identified intangible assets related to the
Pulitzer acquisition had decreased. As a result, the weighted-average useful life of customer lists was decreased from approximately 21 years to 18 years. The change in estimated useful life of such assets resulted in recognition of additional
amortization expense of $1,847,000 in 2006, of which $469,000 is recorded in equity in earnings of TNI. This change in non-cash amortization expense has no impact on the Company s cash flows or debt covenants.            In 2006, the Company also recorded a separate non-cash charge of $5,526,000 to reduce the value of
nonamortized masthead intangible assets of Pulitzer, of which $4,939,000 is recorded in amortization expense and $587,000 is recorded in equity in earnings of TNI. The Company uses a royalty approach to value such assets. Lower than expected revenue
growth resulted in the change in value.            Annual amortization of intangible assets related
to continuing operations for the five years ending September 2011 is estimated to be $60,250,000, $59,705,000, $59,179,000, $59,098,000, and $58,074,000, respectively.         
           Credit Agreement             In December 2005, the Company entered into an amended
and restated credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate borrowing of up to $1,435,000,000 and consists of a $950,000,000 A Term Loan, $35,000,000 B Term Loan and
$450,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement also provides the Company with the right, with the consent of the administrative agent, to request at certain times prior to June 2012 that one or more lenders provide incremental term
loan commitments of up to $500,000,000, subject to certain requirements being satisfied at the time of the request. The Credit Agreement matures in June 2012 and amends and replaces a $1,550,000,000 credit agreement (the Old Credit Agreement)
consummated in June 2005. Interest rate margins under the Credit Agreement are generally lower than under the Old Credit Agreement. Other conditions of the Credit Agreement are substantially the same as the Old Credit Agreement.            The Credit Agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by
substantially all of the Company s existing and future, direct and indirect subsidiaries in which the Company holds a direct or indirect interest of more than 50%; provided however, that Pulitzer and its subsidiaries will not be required to
enter into such guaranty for so long as their doing so would violate the terms of the Pulitzer Notes described more fully below. The Credit Agreement is secured by first priority security interests in the stock and other equity interests owned by
the Company and each guarantor in their respective  
       
   55

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
  
 subsidiaries. Both the guaranties and the collateral that secures them will be released in their entirety at such time as the Company achieves a total leverage ratio
of less than 4:25:1 for two consecutive quarterly periods.            Debt under the A Term Loan
and revolving credit facility bear interest, at the Company s option, at either a base rate or an adjusted Eurodollar rate (LIBOR), plus an applicable margin. The base rate for the facility is the greater of the prime lending rate of Deutsche
Bank Trust Company Americas at such time and 0.5% in excess of the overnight federal funds rate at such time. The margin applicable is a percentage determined according to the following: For revolving loans and A Term Loans, maintained as base rate
loans: 0%, and maintained as Eurodollar loans: 0.625% to 1% (0.875% at September 30, 2006) depending, in each instance, upon the Company s leverage ratio at such time. All loans at September 30, 2006 are Eurodollar-based.   
        The Company may voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding or reduce commitments under the
Credit Agreement at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, upon proper notice and subject to certain limitations as to minimum amounts of prepayments. The Company is required to repay principal amounts, on a quarterly basis until
maturity, under the A Term Loan beginning in September 2006. In addition to the scheduled payments noted above, the Company is required to make mandatory prepayments under the A Term Loan under certain other conditions. Total A Term Loan payments in
2006 total $24,000,000. The Company repaid the B Term Loan in full in 2006.            The Credit
Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financing of its type. These financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio (5.75:1 at September 30, 2006) and minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 2.5:1.
None of the covenants included in the Credit Agreement is considered by the Company to be restrictive to normal operations or historical amounts of stockholder dividends. At September 30, 2006, the Company is in compliance with such covenants.
           The Credit Agreement requires the Company to apply the net proceeds from asset sales to
repayment of the A Term Loan to the extent such proceeds exceed the amount used to purchase assets (other than inventory and working capital) within one year of the asset sales. The Company expects repayments in 2007 to meet or exceed required
repayments related to its 2006 sales transactions.            In 2005, upon consummation of the Old
Credit Agreement, the Company borrowed $1,462,000,000. The proceeds were used to consummate the acquisition of Pulitzer, to repay certain existing indebtedness of the Company, as discussed more fully below, and to pay related fees and expenses.
           In connection with the execution of the Old Credit Agreement, the Company redeemed, as
of June 3, 2005, all of the $52,000,000 outstanding indebtedness under its then existing credit agreement and, as of June 6, 2005, the existing senior notes of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement dated as of March 18, 1998
totaling $102,000,000. Refinancing of existing debt of the Company resulted in a pretax loss of $11,181,000.             Pulitzer Notes              In conjunction with its formation, PD LLC borrowed $306,000,000 (Pulitzer Notes) from a group of institutional lenders (the Lenders). The aggregate principal amount of the Pulitzer
Notes is payable in April 2009 and bears interest at an annual rate of 8.05%. The Pulitzer Notes are guaranteed by Pulitzer pursuant to a Guaranty Agreement dated May 1, 2000 (Guaranty Agreement) with the Lenders. In turn, pursuant to an
Indemnity Agreement dated May 1, 2000 (Indemnity Agreement) between The Herald Company, Inc. (Herald) and Pulitzer, Herald agreed to indemnify Pulitzer for any payments that Pulitzer may make under the Guaranty Agreement.            The terms of the Pulitzer Notes, as amended, contain certain covenants and conditions including the
maintenance, by Pulitzer, of EBITDA, as defined in the Guaranty Agreement, minimum net worth and limitations on the incurrence of other debt. At September 30, 2006, the Company is in compliance with such covenants. In addition, the Pulitzer
Notes and the Operating Agreement with Herald (Operating  
       
   56   

Table of Contents  

Agreement) require that PD LLC maintain a minimum reserve balance, consisting of cash and investments in U.S. government securities, totaling approximately $96,060,000
at September 30, 2006. The Pulitzer Notes and the Operating Agreement provide for a $3,750,000 quarterly increase in the minimum reserve balance through May 1, 2010, when the amount will total $150,000,000. See Note 19.            The purchase price allocation of Pulitzer (see Note 2) resulted in an increase in the value of the
Pulitzer Notes in the amount of $31,512,000, which is recorded as debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount will be accreted over the remaining life of the Pulitzer Notes, until April 2009, as a reduction in interest expense using the
interest method. This accretion will not increase the principal amount due to, or reduce the amount of interest to be paid to, the Lenders.            Debt consists of the following:         
          Aggregate maturities of debt during the five
years ending September 30, 2011 are $35,375,000, $71,250,000, $448,500,000, $166,250,000, and $261,250,000, respectively.

   INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS               In 2005, the Company executed interest rate swaps in the notional amount of $350,000,000 with a forward starting date of November 30, 2005. The interest rate swaps have terms
of two to five years, carry interest rates from 4.2% to 4.4% (plus the applicable LIBOR margin) and effectively fix the Company s interest rate on debt in the amounts, and for the time periods, of such instruments. At September 30,
2006, the Company recorded an asset of $5,234,000 and $2,707,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the fair value of such instruments. The change in this fair value is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of income taxes.   
        At September 30, 2006, after consideration of the interest rate swaps described above,
approximately 57% of the principal amount of the Company s debt is subject to floating interest rates.            In 2005, the Company terminated fixed-to-floating rate interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $150,000,000 previously executed by Pulitzer. The swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges. The Company received cash of
$2,100,000 upon termination.

   PENSION PLANS               The Company and its subsidiaries have several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that together cover a significant number of  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  and selected other employees. Benefits under the plans are generally
based on salary and years of service. The Company s liability and related expense for benefits under the plans are recorded over the service period of active employees based upon annual actuarial calculations. Plan funding strategies are
influenced by tax regulations. Plan assets consist primarily of domestic and foreign corporate equity securities, government and corporate bonds, and cash.            The Company uses a June 30 measurement date for all of its pension obligations.

the investment policy.            The pension trust holds no Company securities, directly or
through separate accounts.             Cash Flows             Based on its forecast at September 30, 2006, the Company expects to make contributions of $130,000
to its pension trust in 2007.            The Company anticipates future benefit payments, which
reflect future service, to be paid from the pension trust as follows:         
           2007 Curtailment             In January 2007, defined pension benefits for certain of the Company s employees will be frozen at
then current levels. As a result, the Company will recognize a curtailment gain of approximately $2,800,000 in 2007.

    Other Plans             The Company is obligated under an unfunded plan to provide certain fixed retirement payments to certain former employees. The plan is frozen and no additional benefits are being
accrued. The accrued liability under the plan is $2,853,000 and $3,006,000 at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.            Certain of the Company s employees participate in multi-employer retirement plans sponsored by their respective bargaining units. The amount charged to operating expense,
representing the Company s required contributions to these plans, is approximately $679,000 in 2006 and $228,000 in 2005.

   POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS               The Company provides retiree medical and life insurance benefits under postretirement plans at several of its operating locations. The level and adjustment of participant
contributions vary depending on the specific plan. In addition, PD LLC provides postemployment disability benefits to certain employee groups prior to retirement at the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  The Company s liability and related expense
for benefits under the postretirement plans are recorded over the service period of active employees based upon annual actuarial calculations. The Company accrues postemployment disability benefits when it becomes probable that such benefits will be
paid and when sufficient information exists to make reasonable estimates of the amounts to be paid.            The Company uses a June 30 measurement date for all of its postretirement obligations.            The net periodic postretirement benefit cost components for the Company s postretirement plans

   The postretirement fund holds no Company securities, directly or through separate accounts.            The Company s postemployment benefit obligation, representing certain disability benefits at
the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch,  is $4,099,000 and $4,146,000 at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.             Cash Flows             Based on its forecast at September 30, 2006, the Company expects to contribute $3,000,000 to its postretirement plans in 2007.            In December 2003 the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was signed into law. The Act introduced a prescription drug benefit under
Medicare (Medicare Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans (Subsidy) that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent (as that term is defined in the Act) to Medicare Part D. The Company concluded
that it qualifies for the Subsidy under the Act since the prescription drug benefits provided under the Company s postretirement health care plans generally require lower premiums from covered retirees and have lower deductibles than the
benefits provided in Medicare Part D and, accordingly, are actuarially equivalent to or better than, the benefits provided under the Act.            The Company anticipates future benefit payments, which reflect future services, to be paid either with future contributions to the plan or directly from plan assets, as follows:
        
           2007 Curtailment             In January 2007, defined postretirement medical benefits for certain of the Company s employees
will be modified. As a result, the Company will recognize a curtailment gain of approximately $1,200,000 in 2007.         

11   
   OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS               Substantially all the Company s employees are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution retirement plan. The Company also has other retirement and compensation plans for executives and others. Retirement
and compensation plan costs, including interest on deferred compensation costs, charged to continuing operations are $25,112,000 in 2006, $22,022,000 in 2005, and $18,044,000 in 2004.            In conjunction with the acquisition of Pulitzer, an existing supplemental executive benefit retirement plan (SERP) was amended and converted into an
individual account plan. An account was established for each participant and was credited with an amount representing the present value of the participant s accrued benefit under the SERP, plus adjustments for certain individuals subject to
existing transition agreements. Interest is credited to each account at an annual rate of 5.75%. The SERP, as amended, will be liquidated on or about May 1, 2008, or earlier upon a change of control of the Company, at which time each
participant will receive a lump sum payment equal to the balance in his account. Retired participants will continue to receive annuity payments until the liquidation of the SERP. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company s liability
under the SERP totals $18,527,000 and $19,054,000, respectively.

   COMMON STOCK, CLASS B COMMON STOCK, AND PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS               Class B Common Stock has ten votes per share on all matters and generally votes as a class with Common Stock (which has one vote per share). The transfer of Class B Common Stock is
restricted. Class B Common Stock is at all times convertible into shares of Common Stock on a share-for-share basis. Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have identical rights with respect to cash dividends and upon liquidation. All outstanding
Class B Common Stock converts to Common Stock when the shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding total less than 5,600,000 shares.            In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan (Plan). Under the Plan, the Board declared a dividend of one Preferred Share Purchase Right (Right) for each
outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (collectively Common Shares) of the Company. Rights are attached to, and automatically trade with, the Company s Common Shares.            Rights become exercisable only in the event that any person or group of affiliated persons becomes a
holder of 20% or more of the Company s outstanding Common Shares, or commences a tender or exchange offer which, if consummated, would result in that person or group of affiliated persons owning at least 20% of the Company s outstanding
Common Shares. Once the Rights become exercisable, they entitle all other stockholders to purchase, by payment of a $150 exercise price, one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating Preferred Stock, subject to adjustment, with a value of
twice the exercise price. In addition, at any time after a 20% position is acquired and prior to the acquisition of a 50% position, the Board of Directors may require, in whole or in part, each outstanding Right (other than Rights held by the
acquiring person or group of affiliated persons) to be exchanged for one share of Common Stock or one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Preferred Stock. The Rights may be redeemed at a price of $0.001 per Right at any time prior to their
expiration in May 2008.

   STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS               Total stock compensation expense is $7,693,000, $7,879,000, and $5,874,000, in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.             Stock Options             The Company has reserved 2,237,305 shares of Common Stock for issuance to employees under an incentive and nonstatutory stock option and restricted stock plan approved by stockholders. Options are granted at a price equal to the fair market
value on the date of the grant and are exercisable, upon vesting, over a ten-year period.            A summary of stock option activity is as follows:         
          Weighted average prices of stock options are as

   The fair value of each grant is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The table below
outlines the weighted average assumptions for options granted.         
          A summary of stock options outstanding at
September 30, 2006 is as follows:         
          Total unrecognized compensation expense for
unvested stock options at September 30, 2006 is $1,660,000, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.1 years.            The exercise of stock options in 2006, 2005 and 2004 resulted in cash proceeds of $3,711,000, $2,289,000 and $10,419,000, respectively, and income tax benefits of $215,000,
$427,000 and $3,092,000, respectively.            The intrinsic value of stock options exercised in
2006, 2005, and 2004 is $552,000, $1,094,000, and $7,929,000, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2006, is $4,900.             Restricted Common Stock             Restricted Common Stock is subject to an agreement requiring forfeiture by the employee in the event of termination of employment, generally within
three years of the grant date for reasons other than normal retirement, death or disability.            A summary of restricted Common Stock activity follows:

Weighted average grant date fair values of restricted Common Stock are as follows:         
          The fair value of restricted Common Stock vested
in 2006, 2005 and 2004 is $3,466,000, $2,565,000 and $1,607,000, respectively.            Total
unrecognized compensation expense for unvested restricted Common Stock as of September 30, 2006 is $5,732,000, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.            At September 30, 2006, 1,298,287 shares are available for granting of stock options or issuance of restricted Common Stock.            In November 2006, 307,130 stock options were granted at an exercise price of $28.72 per share and
193,640 shares of restricted Common Stock were issued.            In November 2004, 40,000 shares
of restricted Common Stock granted to an officer of the Company in November 2003 and 35,000 shares of restricted Common Stock granted in November 2002, were cancelled and reissued. The reissued shares of restricted Common Stock are identical to the
cancelled shares with respect to voting rights, dividends, and timing of vesting. The value per share to the recipient upon vesting is unchanged. Vesting of the cancelled shares was not dependent upon future performance of the Company. The reissued
shares vest only if specified performance criteria are met and additional shares may be issued if the performance criteria are exceeded. As the specified performance was exceeded, 15,000 additional shares of restricted Common Stock were issued in
November 2005. The Company believes the reissued shares meet the criteria for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Due to increases in the price of the Company s Common Stock from the original
grant dates to November 2004, the reissued shares have a fair market value in excess of the cancelled shares in the amount of $706,000, which is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the reissued shares as a modification of an award.
            Stock Purchase Plans             The Company has 541,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance pursuant to the Company s
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). April 28, 2007 is the exercise date for the current offering. The purchase price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value at the date of grant or the exercise date, which is one year from the date of
grant. The Company also has 106,000 shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Company s Supplemental Employee Stock Purchase Plan (SPP). Under the SPP, an offering period is each three-month calendar quarter, unless changed, and
the last business day of each calendar quarter is the exercise date for such quarterly offering period. The purchase price is 85% of the market price on the last business day of each calendar quarter during the offering period. The weighted-average
fair values of purchase rights granted under the ESPP in 2006, 2005, and 2004, computed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, are $6.53, $8.43, and $9.28, respectively. The weighted-average fair values of purchase rights granted under the
SPP in 2006 and 2005, also computed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, are $6.27 and $7.33, respectively.            In 2006, 2005, and 2004 employees purchased 131,000, 89,000 and 88,000 shares, respectively, under the ESPP at a price of $26.11 in 2006, $35.11 in 2005, and $30.25 in 2004. The
market value on the purchase date was $30.80 in 2006, $41.51 in 2005, and $47.78 in 2004. Employees purchased 23,000 and 5,600 shares, respectively, at a weighted average price of $25.67 in 2006 and $36.11 in 2005 under

   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS               The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate value. The carrying amounts
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying value of other investments, consisting of debt and equity securities in a deferred
compensation trust, is carried at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Investments totaling $7,406,000, consisting primarily of the Company s 17% ownership of the nonvoting common stock of TCT and 4.9% interest in Cardinals Holdings LLC,
are carried at cost. The fair value of floating rate debt approximates the carrying amount. The fair value of the Company s fixed rate debt follows and is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the
current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities.

   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES                Newsprint             The Company has contracts for the annual purchase of 197,400 metric tons of newsprint, at market prices, from six suppliers. The commitments represent substantially all of the Company s annual volume, inclusive of MNI, and expire at
various dates through December 2006 and are in various stages of renewal. Contracts with a single supplier represent approximately 59% of the total requirements.             Operating Leases             The Company has operating lease commitments for certain of its office, production, and distribution facilities. Management expects that in the normal course of business, existing
leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum lease payments during the five years ending September 2011 and thereafter are $3,668,000, $2,876,000, $2,447,000, $1,907,000, $1,329,000 and $7,741,000, respectively. Total operating lease
expense is $5,380,000, $3,513,000, and $2,600,000, in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.             Capital Commitments             At September 30, 2006, the Company had
construction and equipment purchase commitments totaling approximately $10,812,000.              St. Louis Post-Dispatch    Early Retirement Program             In 2006,
the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  concluded an offering of early retirement incentives that resulted in an adjustment of staffing levels. 130 employees volunteered to take advantage of the offer, which includes enhanced pension and insurance
benefits and lump-sum cash payments based on continuous service. The cost totaled $17,778,000 before income tax benefit, with $9,124,000 recognized in 2005, and $8,654,000 recognized in 2006. Approximately $7,000,000 of the cost represents cash
payments made, with the remainder due primarily to enhancements of pension and other post retirement benefits.             PD LLC Operating Agreement              On May 1, 2000, Pulitzer and Herald completed the transfer of their respective interests in the assets and operations of the  St. Louis Post-Dispatch  and certain related
businesses to a new joint venture (the Venture), known as PD LLC. Pulitzer is the managing member of PD LLC. Under the terms of the operating agreement governing PD LLC (the Operating Agreement), Pulitzer and another subsidiary hold a 95% interest
in the results of operations of PD LLC and Herald holds a 5% interest. Herald s 5% interest is reported as minority interest in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Also, under the terms of the Operating Agreement,
Herald received on May 1, 2000 a cash distribution of  
       
   69   

Table of Contents  

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
  
 $306,000,000 from PD LLC (the Initial Distribution). This distribution was financed by the Pulitzer Notes. Pulitzer s entry into the Venture was treated as a
purchase for accounting purposes.            During the first ten years of its term, PD LLC is
restricted from making distributions (except under specified circumstances), capital expenditures and member loan repayments unless it has set aside out of its cash flow a reserve equal to the product of $15,000,000 and the number of years since
May 1, 2000, but not in excess of $150,000,000 (the Reserve). PD LLC is not required to maintain the Reserve after May 1, 2010. On May 1, 2010, Herald will have a one-time right to require PD LLC to redeem Herald s interest in PD
LLC, together with Herald s interest, if any, in DS LLC, another limited liability company in which Pulitzer is the managing member and which is engaged in the business of delivering publications and products in the greater St. Louis
metropolitan area. The May 1, 2010 redemption price for Herald s interest will be determined pursuant to a formula yielding an amount which will result in the present value to May 1, 2000 of the after tax cash flows to Herald (based
on certain assumptions) from PD LLC, including the Initial Distribution and the special distribution described below, if any, and from DS LLC, being equal to $275,000,000.            In the event the transactions effected in connection with either the formation of the Venture and the Initial Distribution or the organization of DS
LLC are recharacterized by the IRS as a taxable sale by Herald, with the result in either case that the tax basis of PD LLC s assets increases and Herald is required to recognize taxable income as a result of such recharacterization, Herald
generally will be entitled to receive a special distribution from PD LLC in an amount that corresponds, approximately, to the present value of the after tax benefit to the members of PD LLC of the tax basis increase. The adverse financial effect of
any such special distribution to Herald on PD LLC (and thus Pulitzer and the Company) will be partially offset by the current and deferred tax benefits arising as a consequence of the treatment of the transactions effectuated in connection with the
formation of the Venture and the Initial Distribution or the organization of DS LLC as a taxable sale by Herald. In 2005, the Company was advised that the IRS, in the course of examining the 2000 consolidated federal income tax return in which
Herald was included, requested certain information and documents relating to the transactions effectuated in connection with the formation of the Venture and the Initial Distribution. The Company participated in the formulation of Herald s
response to this IRS request for information and documents. In 2006, the IRS concluded its examination without adjustment related to the Venture or the Initial Distribution and the Company considers the matter closed. The related statute of
limitations expires in December 2007.            Upon termination of PD LLC and DS LLC, which will
be on May 1, 2015 (unless Herald exercises the redemption right described above), Herald will be entitled to the liquidating value of its interests in PD LLC and DS LLC, to be paid in cash by Pulitzer. That amount would be equal to the amount
of Herald s capital accounts, after allocating the gain or loss that would result from a cash sale of PD LLC and DS LLC s assets for their fair market value at that time. Herald s share of such gain or loss generally will be 5%, but
will be reduced (but not below 1%) to the extent that the present value to May 1, 2000 of the after tax cash flows to Herald from PD LLC and from DS LLC, including the Initial Distribution, the special distribution described above, if any, and
the liquidation amount (based on certain assumptions), exceeds $325,000,000.            The actual
amount payable to Herald either on May 1, 2010, or upon the termination of PD LLC and DS LLC on May 1, 2015 will depend on such variables as future cash flows, the amounts of any distributions to Herald prior to such payment, PD LLC s
and DS LLC s rate of growth and market valuations of newspaper properties. While the amount of such payment cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently estimates (assuming a 5% annual growth rate in Herald s capital accounts,
no special distribution as described above and consistent newspaper property valuation multiples) that the amount of such payment would not exceed $100,000,000. The Company further believes that it will be able to finance such payment either from
available cash reserves or by accessing the capital markets. The redemption of Herald s interest in PD LLC either on May 1, 2010 or upon termination of PD LLC in 2015 is expected to generate significant tax benefits to the Company as a
consequence of the resulting increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by PD LLC and DS LLC and the related depreciation and amortization deductions.

Income Taxes             The Company files income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various state tax jurisdictions. From time to time, the Company is subject to routine audits by
those agencies, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. The primary issues in audits currently in process or being contested relate to the appropriate determination of gains, and allocation to the various taxing authorities thereof, on
businesses sold in 2001. The Company may also be subject to claims for transferee income tax liability related to businesses acquired in 2000. The Company has considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing
agencies, believes its positions taken regarding its filings are valid, and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters. However, the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be
material, either positively or negatively, to the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined. The Company does not believe the final resolution of such matters will be
material to its consolidated financial position.            In June 2006, the Company received a
notice of deficiency asserting transferee liability for federal income taxes and penalties, excluding interest, totaling $25,200,000 related to the acquisition of assets by the Company in 2000. In August 2006, the IRS rescinded the notice of
deficiency and issued a letter, which allows the Company to initially pursue this matter at the IRS Appeals level. The Company does not believe the IRS position on this matter has merit and intends to vigorously contest the matter.             Litigation             The Company is involved in a variety of legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. Insurance coverage mitigates potential loss for
certain of these matters. While the Company is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions, it is the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s
Consolidated Financial Statements, taken as a whole.         

20   
   IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS               In October 2005 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement 123-Revised,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  (Statement 123R) and related
FASB staff positions. Statement 123R amends Statement 95,  Statement of Cash Flows , to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid.            Statement 123R also establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges
its equity instruments for goods and services (primarily accounting transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions, such as stock options). Statement 123R requires a public entity to measure the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an equity instrument based on the grant date fair value of the award. In general, the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide the service in exchange for the
award (usually the vesting period). The fair value based methods in Statement 123R are similar to the fair value based method in Statement 123 in most respects. The Company adopted Statement 123 in 2003.            In October 2005 the Company adopted FASB Statement 153,  Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets . This
pronouncement amends APB Opinion 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions . Statement 153 eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets present in APB Opinion 29 and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance (i.e. transactions that are not expected to result in significant changes in the cash flows of the reported entity).            In October 2005 the Company adopted FASB Interpretation 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . Interpretation 47 requires
an entity to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of the settlement are conditional on  
       
   71

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS          
  
 a future event. The liability must be recognized if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.            The adoption of the statements and interpretation discussed above did not have a material impact on the
Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.            In May 2005 the
FASB issued Statement 154,  Accounting Changes and Error Corrections     a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3,  that changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a
change in accounting principle. Statement 154 eliminates the requirement to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in the current period of change and instead, requires that changes in accounting principle be
retrospectively applied. Statement 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not anticipate that the implementation of Statement 154 will have a material impact on its
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.            In July 2006, the FASB issued
Interpretation 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Interpretation 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the
financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement 109. Interpretation 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company
has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company has not completed its evaluation of the effects of Interpretation 48 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.            In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 157,  Fair Value Measurements , which defines fair value, provides guidelines for measuring fair
value and expands disclosure requirements. Statement 157 does not require any new fair value measurement but applies to the accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement. Statement 157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not anticipate that the implementation of Statement 157 will have a material impact on its financial position, results of operation, or cash flows.            In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement 158,  Employer s Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans , which amends statements 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Statement 158 requires the recognition of the over-funded or under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its
balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. Statement 158 is effective at the end of 2007. Had Statement 158 been adopted at September 30, 2006, the Company s
assets would have increased and liabilities would have decreased in the aggregate amount of $44,191,000, less the related income tax effect, and stockholders  equity would have increased by $44,191,000, less the related income tax effect.
Actual adjustments have not been determined as the related actuarial computations have not been performed.            Statement 158 will also require the Company to change its measurement date from June 30 to September 30, beginning in 2008. The change in measurement date will require a one-time adjustment to retained earnings, the effect of
which cannot be determined at this time. None of the changes required will impact the Company s results of operations or cash flows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM             To
the Stockholders      Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries      Davenport, Iowa
           We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Lee Enterprises,
Incorporated and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, Stockholders  Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.            We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.            In our opinion, such
Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lee Enterprises, Incorporated and subsidiaries at September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.            We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2006, based on the criteria established in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated December 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

relates to or arises out of the Excluded Liabilities. The party seeking such cooperation will reimburse the party providing such cooperation for all reasonable expenses (including salaries of employees who are required to be absent from their
employment or devote substantial amounts of time in satisfaction of the obligations set forth in this  Section 5.10 ) incurred by the party providing such cooperation in connection with such cooperation.      5.11  Updating of Lee Disclosure Schedules . Lee shall have the right from time to time after the date hereof to deliver written updates of the Lee
Disclosure Schedules (for purposes of this  Section 5.11 , the  Updated Schedules ) to reflect changes in the Business that occur or arise after the date hereof until the date of the Closing;  provided, however,  that such
Updated Schedules shall reflect matters consistent with the covenants applicable to Lee pursuant to the terms hereof. Such Updated Schedules shall be promptly furnished to Buyer. Buyer shall have five (5) Business Days after receipt of any
Updated Schedules within which to accept or object to such Updated Schedules. In the event Lee delivers Updated Schedules to Buyer prior to the Closing and Buyer does not object within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such Updated
Schedules, the disclosure in the Updated Schedules shall be deemed to amend and supplement the representations and warranties of Lee and the applicable section of the Lee Disclosure Schedules thereto, and in such event Buyer shall not have the right
to be indemnified for any matter contained in the Updated Schedules. If Buyer objects to any Updated Schedules, Lee shall have thirty (30) days in which to satisfy Buyer s objection. If the objection cannot reasonably be cured within
thirty (30) days despite good faith efforts to do so, Lee shall have a reasonable period of time necessary to cure the objection. If Lee does not cure an objection of Buyer to the Updated Schedules, and the objection is material to the
Business, Buyer may elect  
       
   -30-   

to close and pursue the remedies, if any, under   Article 9   of this Agreement or pursue its remedies under   Article 8   hereof;
provided that if such objection is not material to the Business, such objection shall not relieve Buyer of the obligation to close under this Agreement, but Buyer shall retain its rights under   Article 9   with respect to such objection
if such objection constitutes a breach of this Agreement by Lee.      5.12  Additional Covenants of Lee.       (a) Lee and its Affiliates agree to refrain for a period of four (4) years from the Closing Date from publishing a general interest
classified shopper publication that is distributed exclusively through rack distribution in the following counties in Oregon: Multnomah, Clackamas, Hood River, Wasco, Tillamook, Yanhill and Washington, and all counties in Washington situated
primarily west of the Cascade Range (excluding therefrom the Washington counties of Clark, Skamania, Cowlitz, Wahkiakum, Pacific and Lewis).      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of  Section 5.12(a)  above, nothing shall prohibit Lee and its Affiliates from publishing, after the Closing Date, at least a six-day a week major daily paid circulation
newspaper that does not consist primarily of advertising (including the publishing of related publications, whether distributed as part of the newspaper or independently so long as they are affiliated with the newspaper) and is published primarily
in any of the metropolitan areas of Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Bremerton, Everett, Bellingham, Wenatchee or Spokane, Washington or Portland, Oregon.      (c) Lee and its Affiliates agree to refrain for a period of four (4) years from the Closing Date from soliciting any employee of the Business or encouraging such employee to leave such employment;
 provided ,  however . Lee shall be permitted to place general solicitation notices of available positions within Lee and its Affiliates in internal and external print and electronic media and shall be entitled to solicit any person whose
employment is terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates during such period.      (d) If, at the time of enforcement of this
 Section 5.12 , a court holds that the restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties hereto agree that the maximum period, scope or geographic area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated period, scope or area and that the court shall be allowed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the maximum period, scope and area permitted by law.      (e) Lee acknowledges that in the event of any violation of the covenants contained in this  Section 5.12 , Buyer s damages
will be difficult to ascertain and Buyer s remedies at law will be inadequate. Accordingly, Lee agrees that, in addition to such remedies as Buyer may have at law, Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance of such covenants and to an
injunction to prevent any continuing violation thereof.

shall pay final wages to each Business Employee for work performed up to the Closing Date within such time period as required by applicable state Law. Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, offer employment to, and employ all
of the Business Employees employed by Lee on the Closing Date (each a  Hired Employee  and collectively, the  Hired Employees ). Such employment will be effective as of the Closing on terms and conditions substantially equivalent
in the aggregate to those currently received by such Business Employee (excluding any Benefit Plan or plan comparable thereto not currently offered to the employees of Buyer and its Affiliates). Prior to the Closing, neither Lee nor its
Representatives shall induce or encourage any of the Business Employees to decline Buyer s offers of employment or become employed by Lee.      (b) Except as otherwise provided in this   Article 6  , the Hired Employees shall cease active participation in the Benefit Plans effective as of the Closing and shall commence participation in benefit plans
maintained by Buyer (or its Affiliates) in accordance with the terms of Buyer s (or its Affiliates ) plans.      6.2  Welfare
Plans . For all purposes (including vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee welfare benefit plans of Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Hired Employees after the Closing listed in  Schedule
F  hereto (the  New Welfare Plans ), each Hired Employee shall, subject to applicable Law and applicable IRC requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with Lee or its Affiliates before the Closing to the same extent as
such Hired Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan immediately prior to the Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Hired Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Welfare Plans if such Hired Employee participated
immediately before the Closing in a comparable type of welfare benefit plan of Lee Enterprises (such plans, collectively, the  Old Plans  and (ii) for purposes of each New Welfare Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
and/or vision benefits to any Hired Employee, Buyer or its Affiliates shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Welfare Plan to be waived for such Hired Employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of Lee in which such Hired Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Closing Date to be taken into account under such New Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all

Employee, severance in an amount equal to at least the Buyer Severance Amount (as hereinafter defined). For purposes hereof, (i)  Eligible Hired Employee  means each of Lee s employees regularly scheduled to work twenty
(20) or more hours per week who is employed by Lee solely in connection with the operation of the Business prior to the Closing Date (other than as listed in Section 6.3 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules) and who is terminated by Lee
effective as of the Closing and who is terminated by Buyer or one of its Affiliates without cause within six (6) months of the Closing Date and who delivers to Buyer a release of claims reasonably acceptable to Buyer; and (ii)  Buyer
Severance Amount  means with respect to each Eligible Hired Employee, an amount equal to (A) one week of his or her base cash compensation, determined immediately prior to the Closing Date and excluding any overtime, bonuses and
commissions ( Base Compensation ) and, for those whose compensation is based solely on commissions or sales incentive pay, one week of his or her commissions and sales incentive pay earned or which he or she is eligible to earn (determined

service (rounded to the nearest one-fifth year) with the Business or with any other publication or division owned (directly or indirectly) by Lee up to a maximum of twelve (12) years.      No other provision of this  Section 6.3  describing Buyer s liability or responsibility shall be interpreted to limit the liability or
responsibility that Buyer has under this  Section 6.3(b) , except to the extent that such other provision specifically makes Lee liable or responsible. For purposes of this  Section 6.3(b) , references to Buyer shall include
Buyer and its Affiliates.      6.4  Savings Plans . Buyer shall take all steps necessary to permit each such Hired Employee who has
received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the IRC) from the Lee Enterprises Retirement Account Plan to roll over such distribution as part of any lump sum cash distribution into an account under a 401(k)
savings plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer shall credit the service of each Hired Employee with Lee or its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Buyer s savings plan.

Buyer to implement, or limiting the rights of Buyer to amend or discontinue, any fringe benefit plan, program or practice or any other employee benefit plan of any nature whatsoever, except as expressly provided otherwise in this   Article
6   or (c) conferring upon any Hired Employee any rights or remedies under this Agreement (including under this   Article 6  ).

of any Proceeding against it, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying Party under such Section, give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the Indemnifying
Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party s
failure to give such notice.      (b) If any Proceeding referred to in  Section 9.5(a)  is brought against an
Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (x) the Indemnifying
Party is also a party to such Proceeding and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (y) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its
financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this   Article 9   for any fees of
other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, regardless of the
amount; (ii) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party s consent unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party;
and (iii) the Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the
Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party s notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any
determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the Indemnified Party of such Proceeding, in each case, with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
     9.6  Procedure for Indemnification   Other Claims . A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim
may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought.      9.7  Limitations on Indemnification .      (a) No claim for indemnification under  Section 9.2(a)  or  Section 9.3(a)  for breach of any representation or
warranty shall be valid unless made within the applicable survival period as set forth  Section 9.1 .

in which event all Losses above $500,000 shall be indemnifiable;  provided  that Buyer s right to recover under  Section 9.3(a)  for breach of any representation or warranty contained in  Sections 3.2(a) ,  3.2(b) ,
 3.12  or  3.17  shall not be subject to such limitation.      (c) No individual breach of any such representation or
warranty shall be deemed to have occurred unless the actual Loss incurred as a result thereof is in excess of $2,000. In no event shall the aggregate liability of Lee pursuant to  Section 9.3 (a)  exceed $10,500,000;  provided
 that Buyer s right to recover under  Section 9.3(a)  for breach of any representation or warranty contained in  Sections 3.2(a) ,  3.2(b) ,  3.12  or  3.17  shall not be subject to such limitation. In no event
shall the aggregate liability of Lee or Buyer pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Purchase Price.      (d) If Buyer acquires
Knowledge prior to Closing that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Lee contained in this Agreement or the Lee Disclosure Schedules (including Updated Schedules pursuant to  Section 5.11 ) or any of the Schedules
attached hereto has been breached, is false or requires modification or amendment to be correct, Buyer shall provide Lee with written notice as soon as practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business Days after acquiring such Knowledge.
Buyer shall have no right or remedy after the Closing with respect to such inaccuracy or breach and shall be deemed to have waived its rights to indemnification in respect thereof and any Loss in respect thereof shall be disregarded for purposes of
the deductible contained in  Section 9.7(b) .      (e) No party shall be liable under   Article 9   for any
(i) Loss relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in the calculation of Effective Time Working Capital a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter, but only to the extent of such reserve, (ii) consequential
or punitive Loss (other than a consequential or punitive Loss payable in connection with a third-party claim), or (iii) Loss based on a claim for lost profits (other than lost profits payable in connection with a third-party claim).

Law including claims under applicable state and federal securities laws and except for covenants contained herein which by their terms are to be performed at or after the Closing and  Section 10.1 , the indemnification obligations under
this   Article 9   shall be the sole and the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement by any party hereto or any certificate delivered in
connection herewith, except that, subject to   Article 8   hereof, nothing herein or in any such certificate shall be construed or interpreted as limiting or impairing the rights or remedies that the parties hereto may have at equity for
injunctive relief or specific performance of this Agreement.

United States located in the State of Delaware (in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity). In addition, each party hereby:      (a) submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of (i) the courts of the State of Delaware, and (ii) the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware with respect to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby to the extent such courts would have subject matter jurisdiction with respect to such dispute;      (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any
such court; and      (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement (or any transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in any court order than such courts referred to above.      10.12  Severability . Each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any
other provision, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included herein.       [SIGNATURE PAGE TO FOLLOW]

by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the party to receive such payment. Any payment made pursuant to this  Section 2.3(b)(iii)  shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price and
included in the allocation of the Purchase Price set forth in   Schedule G   pursuant to  Section 2.3(c)  hereof and allocated to purchase of working capital.      (iv) If Buyer disagrees with the Statement of Working Capital, then Buyer shall notify Lee in writing (the  Notice of
Disagreement ) of such disagreement within fifteen (15) calendar days following delivery of the Statement of Working Capital. If Lee has not received a Notice of Disagreement within such fifteen (15) day period, Buyer shall be deemed
to have accepted the Statement of Working Capital. Any Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the adjustments Buyer proposes to make to the Statement of Working Capital and the basis therefor and shall be consistent with the
provisions of  Section 2.3(b)(ii) . Thereafter, Lee and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to resolve and finally determine the amount of the Closing Working Capital. If Lee and Buyer are unable to resolve the disagreement within thirty
(30) calendar days following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, then Lee and Buyer shall select a mutually acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not then have a present relationship with Lee or Buyer (the
 Independent Accountant ), to resolve the disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto. If Lee and Buyer are unable, within ten (10) calendar days, to select a mutually acceptable Independent Accountant, then each of Lee
and Buyer shall select a nationally  
       
   -8-   

recognized independent accounting firm and these two firms will choose a nationally recognized independent accounting firm which will serve as the
Independent Accountant. The determination of the Independent Accountant to resolve the disagreement between Lee and Buyer as to the Statement of Working Capital will be made, and written notice thereof given to Lee and Buyer, within thirty

Effect or except as otherwise described in Section 3.13 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules, (a) as of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Lee, threatened claims by any Person

has disclosed any such claim of a violation or infringement of which, to the Knowledge of Lee, it has received written notice, on the Disclosure Schedules irrespective of whether it has had or may reasonably be expected to have a Business Material
Adverse Effect).      Except as otherwise described in Section 3.13 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules, no other Person (i) has the
right to use any trademarks included in the Intellectual Property either in identical form or in such near resemblance thereto as to be likely to cause confusion with the trademarks or to cause a mistake or to deceive, or (ii) has notified
Seller that it is claiming any ownership of or right to use such Intellectual Property which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect (provided Lee has disclosed any such claim of ownership or right to use of
which, to the Knowledge of Lee, it has received written notice, on the Disclosure Schedules irrespective of whether it has had or may reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect).      All of the Intellectual Property rights are valid and enforceable rights of Lee and will not cease to be valid and in full force and in effect by reason
of the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to have such valid and enforceable rights would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Business Material Adverse Effect (provided Lee has disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules any such failure of which it has Knowledge, irrespective of whether it has had or may reasonably be expected to have a Business Material Adverse Effect).
     3.14  Real Property . Section 3.14 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules sets forth a list of material real property currently owned
or leased by Lee and used in the operation of the Business. Lee owns and has valid title to all of its owned real property and has valid leasehold interests in all of its leased properties used in the operation of the Business, except for properties
and Assets that have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business since June 30, 2006, free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Liens and all other title exceptions, defects, encumbrances and other matters, whether or not of
record, which do not materially and adversely affect the continued use of the property for the purposes for which the property is currently being used by Lee in the Business as of the date hereof, excluding therefrom mortgages, deeds of trust,
judgment liens, Tax liens for delinquent taxes and other monetary liens). Buyer acknowledges that Lee has not investigated whether the landlord to any leased premises has marketable title to such property. Except as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect, each of Lee s material lease agreements involving real property related to the operation of the Business to which Lee is a party is valid and enforceable and Lee is not in default under any
such agreement, and no circumstances exist which, with notice, the passage of  
       
   -20-

Business has no lease considered a capitalized lease under GAAP primarily for the benefit of the Business.      (b) To its
Knowledge, Lee is not in breach of or in default under the terms of any Business Material Contract. To the Knowledge of Lee, no other party to any Business Material Contract is in breach of or in default under the terms thereof where such breach or
default would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. Each Business Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of Lee and, to the Knowledge of Lee, of each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors  rights generally, and (ii) equitable

seeking such cooperation will reimburse the party providing such cooperation for all reasonable expenses (including salaries of employees who are required to be absent from their employment or devote substantial amounts of time in satisfaction of
the obligations set forth in this  Section 5.10 ) incurred by the party providing such cooperation in connection with such cooperation.      5.11  Updating of Lee Disclosure Schedules . Lee shall have the right from time to time after the date hereof to deliver written updates of the Lee Disclosure Schedules (for purposes of this  Section 5.11 , the  Updated
Schedules ) to reflect changes in the Business that occur or arise after the date hereof until the date of the Closing;  provided, however,  that such Updated Schedules shall substantially reflect matters consistent with the covenants
applicable to Lee pursuant to the terms hereof. Such Updated Schedules shall be promptly furnished to Buyer. Buyer shall have five (5) Business Days after receipt of any Updated Schedules within which to accept or object to such Updated
Schedules. In the event Lee delivers Updated Schedules to Buyer prior to the Closing and Buyer does not object within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such Updated Schedules, the disclosure in the Updated Schedules shall be deemed to
amend and supplement the representations and warranties of Lee and the applicable section of the Lee Disclosure Schedules thereto, and in such event Buyer shall not have the right to be indemnified for any matter contained in the Updated Schedules.
If Buyer objects to any item (an  
       
   -30-   

Objectionable Item ) in the Updated Schedules, Lee shall have thirty (30) days in which to satisfy Buyer s objection. If the
Objectionable Item cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days despite good faith efforts to do so, Lee shall have a reasonable period of time necessary to cure the Objectionable Item. If Lee does not cure an Objectionable Item, and the
Objectionable Item is material to the Business, Buyer may elect to close and pursue the remedies, if any, under   Article 9   of this Agreement or pursue its remedies under   Article 8   hereof; provided that if Objectionable
Item is not material to the Business, such objection shall not relieve Buyer of the obligation to close under this Agreement, but Buyer shall retain its rights under   Article 9   with respect to the Objectionable Item if the existence of
the Objectionable Item constitutes a breach of this Agreement by Lee.       ARTICLE 6        EMPLOYMENT MATTERS       6.1  Acquired
Employees.       (a) Lee shall, after notifying Buyer of its intent thereto and after first allowing Buyer to be present at
and to participate during or in connection with such notification (if Buyer desires), provide all Business Employees with notification of the sale of the Business and the termination of each such employee s employment with Lee on the Closing
Date as a result thereof. Lee shall pay final wages to each Business Employee for work performed up to the Closing Date within such time period as required by applicable state Law. Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, offer
employment to, and employ all of the Business Employees employed by Lee on the Closing Date (each a  Hired Employee  and collectively, the  Hired Employees ),  provided, however,  that each Hired Employee shall be employed
on an  at will  basis and may be discharged, subject to the provisions of  Section 6.3 , at any time with or without cause and with or without notice. Such employment will be effective as of the Closing on terms and conditions
substantially equivalent in the aggregate to those currently received by such Business Employee (excluding any Benefit Plan or plan comparable thereto not currently offered to the employees of Buyer and its Affiliates). Prior to the Closing, neither
Lee nor its Representatives shall induce or encourage any of the Business Employees to decline Buyer s offers of employment or become employed by Lee.      (b) Except as otherwise provided in this   Article 6  , the Hired Employees shall cease active participation in the Benefit Plans effective as of the Closing and shall commence participation in benefit plans
maintained by Buyer (or its Affiliates) in accordance with the terms of Buyer s (or its Affiliates ) plans.      6.2  Welfare
Plans . For all purposes (including vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee welfare benefit plans of Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Hired Employees after the Closing listed on
  Schedule H   (the  New Welfare Plans ), each Hired Employee shall, subject to applicable Law and applicable IRC requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with Lee or its Affiliates before the  
       
   -31-   

Closing to the same extent as such Hired Employee was entitled to credit for such service under any similar employee benefit plan immediately prior to the
Closing, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Hired Employee shall become eligible
to participate, to the extent permissible by the IRC and the New Welfare Plans, without any waiting time, in any and all New Welfare Plans if such Hired Employee participated immediately before the Closing in a comparable type of welfare benefit
plan of Lee Enterprises (such plans, collectively, the  Old Plans  and (ii) for purposes of each New Welfare Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Hired Employee, Buyer or its Affiliates shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Welfare Plan to be waived for such Hired Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable
plans of Lee in which such Hired Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing or under the existing comparable plans of the Buyer, and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the Closing Date to be taken into account under such New Welfare Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Welfare Plan.      6.3  Severance and Participation Agreement Liabilities .      (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
assume, pay or otherwise discharge, and shall indemnify and hold Lee harmless against any liability, claim or obligation (including reasonable attorney s fees) relating to or arising out of the Benefit Plans covering Business Employees set
forth in Section 6.3 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules. Buyer agrees that it shall have no right or ability to amend any term or condition of any such agreements set forth in Section 6.3 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules without the consent of
the benefited employee.      (b) Buyer shall pay, within five (5) days of termination of employment (and for those
executing ADEA releases, within five (5) days after the ADEA waiting periods expire), in a lump-sum cash payment to each Eligible Hired Employee, severance in an amount equal to at least the Buyer Severance Amount (as hereinafter defined). For
purposes hereof, (i)  Eligible Hired Employee  means each of Lee s employees regularly scheduled to work twenty (20) or more hours per week (A) who is employed by Lee solely in connection with the operation of the
Business prior to the Closing Date (other than as listed in Section 6.3 of the Lee Disclosure Schedules) and who is terminated by Lee effective as of the Closing, or (B) who is terminated by Buyer or one of its Affiliates without cause
within six (6) months of the Closing Date and who delivers to Buyer a release of claims reasonably acceptable to Buyer; and (ii)  Buyer Severance Amount  means with respect to each Eligible Hired Employee, an amount equal to
(A) one week of his or her base cash compensation, determined as of July 31, 2006 and excluding any overtime, bonuses and commissions and, for those whose compensation is based solely on commissions or sales incentive pay, one week of his
or her commissions and sales incentive pay earned or which he or she is eligible to earn (determined by calculating his or her commissions  
       
   -32-   

and sales incentive pay for the twelve (12) months ended July 31, 2006 divided by fifty-two (52)), multiplied by (B) his or her years of
continuous service (rounded to the nearest one-fifth year) with the Business or with any other publication or division owned (directly or indirectly) by Lee up to a maximum of twelve (12) years.      No other provision of this  Section 6.3  describing Buyer s liability or responsibility shall be interpreted to limit the liability or
responsibility that Buyer has under this  Section 6.3(b) , except to the extent that such other provision specifically makes Lee liable or responsible. For purposes of this  Section 6.3(b) , references to Buyer shall include
Buyer and its Affiliates.      6.4  Savings Plans . Buyer shall take all steps necessary to permit each such Hired Employee who has
received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the IRC) from the Lee Enterprises Retirement Account Plan to roll over such distribution as part of any lump sum cash distribution into an account under a 401(k)
savings plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer shall credit the service of each Hired Employee with Lee or its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility and vesting under Buyer s savings plan.      6.5  Vacation . Except as may otherwise be required by Law, on the Closing Date, but effective as of the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume
Lee s liability for all earned, but unpaid vacation and leave of absence time of Hired Employees to the extent such liability is not already an Assumed Liability, provided that such liability is reflected in the Statement of Working Capital.
     6.6  General . Nothing in this   Article 6   or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed as (a) conferring any
legal rights upon any Hired Employee for continuation of employment by Buyer or its Affiliates, (b) requiring Buyer to implement, or limiting the rights of Buyer to amend or discontinue, any fringe benefit plan, program or practice or any other
employee benefit plan of any nature whatsoever, except as expressly provided otherwise in this   Article 6   or (c) conferring upon any Hired Employee any rights or remedies under this Agreement (including under this   Article
6  ), as a third party beneficiary or otherwise.      6.7  Reimbursements . If Lee pays wages, salaries or benefit payments for any
Hired Employee for a period after the Effective Time, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Lee for such payments. If Buyer pays wages, salaries or benefit payments for any Hired Employee for a period prior to the Effective Time, Lee shall promptly
reimburse Buyer for such payments.       ARTICLE 7        CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATIONS       7.1  Conditions to Each Party s Obligation . The

Party ) shall give notice to the party required to provide such indemnification (the  Indemnifying Party ) promptly after such Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claims as to which indemnity is sought, and shall permit the
Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any third party claim or Proceeding resulting therefrom pursuant to  Section 9.5 ;  provided, however,  that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this   Article 9   except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been adversely affected by such failure. The Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding itself
or the claim in question as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and shall otherwise cooperate with the Indemnifying Party to such extent as shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of such claim and litigation

   -37-   

Section 9.3  of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against it, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an
Indemnifying Party under such Section, give notice to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party s failure to give such notice.      (b) If any Proceeding referred to in  Section 9.5(a)  is brought against an Indemnified Party and it gives notice to the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (x) the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Proceeding and the
Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (y) the Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Party of its financial capacity to defend such Proceeding and
provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this   Article 9   for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect
to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) no compromise or settlement of
such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party s consent unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (ii) the Indemnified Party will have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the Indemnifying Party does not, within thirty (30) days
after the Indemnified Party s notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination made in such Proceeding or any compromise or
settlement effected by the Indemnified Party.      9.6  Procedure for Indemnification   Other Claims . The term  Losses  is
not limited to matters asserted by third parties, but includes Losses incurred or sustained by a party in the absence of third party claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-party claim may be asserted by notice to
the party from whom indemnification is sought.      9.7  Limitations on Indemnification .      (a) No claim for indemnification under  Section 9.2(a)  or  Section 9.3(a)  for breach of any representation or
warranty shall be valid unless made within the applicable survival period as set forth  Section 9.1 .      (b) No
party shall be obligated to indemnify any other party or parties under  Section 9.2(a)  or  Section 9.3(a)  unless the claimant s aggregate amount of Losses as to which a  
       
   -38-   

right of indemnification is provided under  Section 9.2(a)  or  Section 9.3(a)  shall exceed $180,000, in which event all Losses above
$180,000 shall be indemnifiable;  provided  that Buyer s right to recover under  Section 9.3(a)  for breach of any representation or warranty contained in  Sections   3.2(a) ,  3.2(b) ,  3.12  or  3.17 
shall not be subject to such limitation.      (c) No individual breach of any such representation or warranty shall be deemed to
have occurred unless the actual Loss incurred as a result thereof is in excess of $2,000. In no event shall the aggregate liability of Lee pursuant to  Section 9.3(a)  exceed $1,800,000;  provided  that Buyer s right to recover
under  Section 9.3(a)  for breach of any representation or warranty contained in  Sections   3.2(a) ,  3.2(b) ,  3.6 ,  3.12  or  3.17  shall not be subject to such limitation. In no event shall the aggregate
liability of Lee or Buyer pursuant to this Agreement exceed the Purchase Price.      (d) If Buyer acquires Knowledge prior to
Closing that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Lee contained in this Agreement or the Lee Disclosure Schedules (including Updated Schedules pursuant to  Section 5.11 ) or any of the Schedules attached hereto has been
breached, is false or requires modification or amendment to be correct, Buyer shall provide Lee with written notice as soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the Closing. If Buyer fails to give such notice, Buyer shall have no right or
remedy after the Closing with respect to such inaccuracy or breach and shall be deemed to have waived its rights to indemnification in respect thereof and any Loss in respect thereof shall be disregarded for purposes of the deductible contained in
 Section 9.7(b) .      (e) No party shall be liable under   Article 9   for any (i) Loss relating to
any matter to the extent that there is included in the calculation of Closing Working Capital a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter, but only to the extent of such reserve, (ii) Consequential Damages or punitive Loss (other
than a consequential or punitive Loss payable in connection with a third-party claim), or (iii) Loss based on a claim for lost profits which are not Allowable Lost Profits (other than lost profits payable in connection with a third-party
claim).      (f) This  Section 9.7  shall have no application to Lee s indemnification obligations with respect
to Excluded Liabilities. Lee s obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party against an Excluded Liability shall be without limitation as to time or amount.      9.8  Exclusive Remedy . Subject to the applicability of   Article 8   hereof, except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law including claims under applicable state and federal securities
laws and except for covenants contained herein which by their terms are to be performed at or after the Closing and  Section 10.1 , the indemnification obligations under this   Article 9   shall be the sole and the exclusive
remedy of the parties hereto with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement by any party hereto or any certificate delivered in connection herewith, except that, subject to   Article 8 
 hereof, nothing herein or in any such certificate shall be construed or interpreted as limiting or impairing the rights or remedies that the parties hereto may have: (i) at equity for injunctive relief or specific performance of this
Agreement; (ii) at law for fraud or intentional torts.

Except as may be required by applicable Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, for a period of three
(3) years following the Closing, Lee will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) take commercially reasonable steps comparable to those steps Lee takes with regard to its own similar confidential information to protect the confidentiality of all
confidential information related to the Business in the possession of Lee and its Subsidiaries (other than information which is or becomes known to the public other than through a breach of this Section by Lee). Except as may be required by
applicable Law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, Lee agrees to keep confidential the provisions of  Section 6.3(b) .      10.10  Amendments: Waiver . This Agreement may not be amended or modified except by written agreement of the parties. No breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty made herein shall be deemed waived unless expressly
waived in writing by the party who might assert such breach.      10.11  Enforcement . The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its terms or were otherwise breached. Each party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent any breach of this Agreement and to enforce this Agreement specifically
in any court of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware (in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity). In addition, each party hereby:      (a) submits itself to the personal jurisdiction of (i) the courts of the State of Delaware, and (ii) the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware with respect to any dispute arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby to the extent such courts would have subject matter jurisdiction with respect to such dispute;      (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any
such court; and      (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement (or any transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in any court order than such courts referred to above.      10.12  Severability . Each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any
other provision, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been included herein.
