Item 1.        Business     

   Overview   

  Barnwell
enjoyed its 50th year of operations in fiscal 2006, having been incorporated in
Delaware in 1956.  Barnwell has the
following three principal business segments:  

                         Oil and Natural Gas Segment . 
Barnwell engages in oil and natural gas exploration, development,
production and sales, primarily in Canada. 

                         Land Investment Segment . 
Barnwell invests in leasehold interests in real estate in Hawaii. 

                         Contract Drilling Segment . 
Barnwell provides well drilling services, contract labor servicing for
geothermal well drilling and workovers, and water pumping system installation
and repair in Hawaii. 

  Barnwell s
oil and natural gas activities comprise its largest business segment.  Approximately 66% of Barnwell s revenues for
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was attributable to its oil and
natural gas activities.  Barnwell s land
investment segment revenues accounted for 21% of fiscal 2006 revenues; Barnwell s
contract drilling activities accounted for 10% of fiscal 2006 revenues; and
other revenues comprised 3% of fiscal 2006 revenues.  Approximately 98% of Barnwell s capital
expenditures for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 was attributable
to oil and natural gas activities and 2% was applicable to its other
activities.  

   Oil and
Natural Gas Segment   

   Overview   

  Barnwell s wholly-owned
subsidiary, Barnwell of Canada, Limited ( Barnwell of Canada ), is involved in
the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas
properties.  Barnwell of Canada initiates
and participates in exploratory and developmental operations for oil and
natural gas on property in which it has an interest, and evaluates proposals by
third parties with regard to participation in such exploratory and developmental
operations elsewhere.  

   Operations   

  Barnwell s
investments in oil and natural gas properties consist of investments in Canada,
principally in the Province of Alberta, with minor holdings in the Provinces of
Saskatchewan and British Columbia.  These
property interests are principally held under governmental leases or
licenses.  Under the typical Canadian
provincial governmental lease, Barnwell must perform exploratory operations and
comply with certain other conditions. 
Lease terms vary with each province, but, in general, the terms grant
Barnwell the right to remove oil, natural gas and related substances subject to
payment of specified royalties on production.  

4     

Barnwell
initiates and participates in exploratory and developmental operations for oil
and natural gas on property in which it has an interest.  Barnwell also evaluates proposals by third
parties for participation in other exploratory and developmental
opportunities.  All exploratory and
developmental operations are overseen by Barnwell s Calgary, Alberta staff
along with senior management and independent consultants as necessary.  In fiscal 2006, Barnwell participated in
exploratory and developmental operations in the Canadian Province of Alberta,
although Barnwell does not limit its consideration of exploratory and
developmental operations to this area.  

  The
Province of Alberta determines its royalty share of natural gas and of oil by
using reference prices that average all natural gas sales and oil sales,
respectively, in Alberta.  Royalty rates
are calculated on a sliding scale basis, increasing as prices increase up to a
maximum royalty rate of 35%. 
Additionally, Barnwell pays gross overriding royalties and leasehold
royalties on a portion of its natural gas and oil sales to parties other than
the Province of Alberta.    

  In
fiscal 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average rate of all royalties paid on all of
Barnwell s natural gas was approximately 28% and 27%, respectively.  The weighted-average rate of all royalties
paid to governments and others on natural gas from the Dunvegan Unit, Barnwell s
principal oil and natural gas property, was approximately 30% and 31% in fiscal
2006 and 2005, respectively.  The
increase in royalty rate on all properties was primarily due to higher average
natural gas prices.  The increase was
partially offset by the lower average royalty rate at Dunvegan in fiscal 2006
as compared to fiscal 2005 which was due to royalty credits received from the
Alberta Department of Energy for prior year capital and operating expenditures
incurred by Barnwell on the Dunvegan property for the processing of natural
gas.  

  In
fiscal 2006 and 2005, the weighted-average royalty rate paid on oil was
approximately 23% and 24%, respectively. 
The decrease in the weighted-average royalty rate on oil was primarily
due to a higher percentage of Barnwell s fiscal 2006 production of oil coming
from newer wells where royalties are assessed at a lower rate than on older
wells.  

  Prices
of natural gas are typically higher in the winter than at other times due to demand
for heating.  Prices of oil are also
subject to seasonal fluctuations, but to a lesser degree.  Unit sales of oil and natural gas are based
on the quantity produced from the properties by the operator.  During periods of low demand for natural gas,
the operator of the Dunvegan property may re-inject natural gas into
underground storage facilities for delivery at a future date.  

   Well
Drilling Activities   

  During
fiscal 2006, Barnwell participated in the drilling of 40 gross development
wells and seven gross exploratory wells, of which management believes 40 should
be capable of production and seven are dry holes.    

5     

The
following table sets forth more detailed information with respect to the number
of exploratory ( Exp. ) and development ( Dev. ) wells drilled for the fiscal
years ended September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 in which Barnwell
participated:  

*                    The term  Gross 
refers to the total number of wells in which Barnwell owns an interest, and  Net 
refers to Barnwell s aggregate interest therein.  For example, a 50% interest in a well
represents one gross well, but 0.5 net well. 
The gross figure includes interests owned of record by Barnwell and, in
addition, the portion owned by others. 

  Barnwell
invested $25,949,000 in oil and natural gas properties during fiscal 2006, of
which $3,273,000 (13%) was for acquisition of leases and lease rentals,
$1,870,000 (7%) was for geological and geophysical costs, $15,878,000 (61%) was
for intangible drilling costs, $4,328,000 (17%) was for production equipment,
and $600,000 (2%) was for future site restoration and abandonment and other
costs.  The major areas of investments in
fiscal 2006 were in the Progress, Pouce Coupe South, Simonette, Dunvegan,
Swalwell, Josephine, Bonanza/Balsam, and Doris areas of Alberta.    

  The
Dunvegan Unit, in which Barnwell holds an 8.9% working interest, is Barnwell s
principal oil and natural gas property and is located in Alberta, Canada.  At September 30, 2006, the Dunvegan Unit
had  197 producing
natural gas wells.  In fiscal 2006,
Barnwell participated in the drilling of 12 gross (1.1 net) development gas
wells in the Dunvegan area, all of which were successful.  Total capital expenditures at Dunvegan were
$1,781,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to $4,299,000 and $3,670,000 in fiscal
2005 and 2004, respectively.  Barnwell expects that fiscal 2007 capital
expenditures at Dunvegan will decline slightly from fiscal 2006 s level with
the anticipated drilling of 10 gross (0.9 net) development gas wells. 

  Capital
expenditures totaled $917,000 in the Doris area in fiscal 2006 as compared to
$2,023,000 in fiscal 2005.  One gross
(0.5 net) well was drilled in fiscal 2006 which is currently considered
successful.  In the Doris area Barnwell
acquired oil and natural gas rights in 3,840 gross (2,240 net) acres of
undeveloped land in fiscal 2006.  At
September 30, 2006 Barnwell s average working interest in its productive
wells in the Doris area was 46%. 
Barnwell expects to drill two to four gross wells in the Doris area in
fiscal 2007.  

  Capital
expenditures totaled $850,000 in the Bonanza/Balsam area in fiscal 2006 as
compared to $1,987,000 in fiscal 2005. 
Two gross (0.6 net) wells were drilled in fiscal 2006 which were   

6     

successful and
tied in and producing at September 30, 2006.  In the Bonanza/Balsam area Barnwell acquired
oil and natural gas rights in 1,920 gross (940 net) acres of undeveloped land
in fiscal 2006.  At September 30,
2006 Barnwell s average working interest in its productive wells in the
Bonanza/Balsam area was 31%.  

  Capital
expenditures totaled $6,094,000 in the Progress area in fiscal 2006 as compared
to $1,670,000 in fiscal 2005.  Three
gross (1.7 net) wells were drilled in fiscal 2006 of which one gross (0.4 net)
well was successful and tied in and producing at September 30, 2006 and
two gross (1.3 net) wells were successful but awaiting tie-in.  In the Progress area Barnwell acquired oil
and natural gas rights in 640 gross (420 net) acres of undeveloped land in
fiscal 2006.  At September 30, 2006
Barnwell s average working interest in its productive wells in the Progress
area was 37%.  Barnwell plans on drilling
four to six gross wells in the Progress area in fiscal 2007.    

  Capital
expenditures totaled $867,000 in the Wood River area in fiscal 2006 as compared
to $531,000 in fiscal 2005.  Two gross
(0.3 net) wells were successfully drilled in fiscal 2006.  At September 30, 2006 Barnwell s average
working interest in its productive wells in the Wood River area was 13%.  Barnwell expects to drill three gross wells
in the Wood River area in fiscal 2007.  

  Capital
expenditures totaled $2,101,000 in the Pouce Coupe South area in fiscal 2006 as
compared to $173,000 in fiscal 2005.  Two
gross (0.9 net) wells were successfully drilled in fiscal 2006.  At September 30, 2006 Barnwell s average
working interest in its productive wells in the Pouce Coupe South area was
53%.  Barnwell plans on drilling two
gross wells in the Pouce Coupe South area in fiscal 2007.  

  Capital
expenditures totaled $1,890,000 in the Simonette area in fiscal 2006.  One gross (0.1 net) well was successful and
one gross (0.5 net) well drilled in fiscal 2005 initially estimated to be
productive was determined to be unsuccessful.  

  Capital
expenditures totaled $1,102,000 in the Swalwell area in fiscal 2006 where oil
and natural gas rights in 3,360 gross (3,350 net) acres of undeveloped land
were acquired and where one gross (0.3 net) unsuccessful well was drilled.  

  Capital
expenditures totaled $1,101,000 in the Josephine area in fiscal 2006, a new
area for Barnwell, where oil and natural gas rights in 640 gross (420 net)
acres of undeveloped land were acquired and where one gross (0.5 net)
successful well was drilled.  

  Barnwell s
average working interest in wells drilled in fiscal 2006 was approximately 29%,
as compared to 17% in fiscal 2005 and 10% in fiscal 2004.  The increase in fiscal 2006, as compared to
fiscal 2005 was due to Barnwell taking a higher working interest in projects
that were internally developed and initiated. 
In fiscal 2006, Barnwell initiated 28 gross (  11.7   net) wells
as compared to 27 gross (8.8 net) wells in fiscal 2005.  The increase in fiscal 2005, as compared to
fiscal 2004, was principally due to an 81 gross (2.7 net) well shallow gas
drilling program in fiscal 2004 in the Hilda area, where Barnwell s interest
averaged 3.3%, reducing Barnwell s average net interest in fiscal 2004.  

7     

Oil and
Natural Gas Production   

  The
following table summarizes (a) Barnwell s net unit production for the last
three fiscal years, based on sales of crude oil, natural gas, condensate and
other natural gas liquids, from all wells in which Barnwell has or had an interest,
and (b) the average sales prices and average production costs for such
production during the same periods. 
Production amounts reported are net of royalties and the Alberta Royalty
Tax Credit.  Barnwell s net production in
fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 was derived primarily from the Province of Alberta.

oil and natural gas revenues were from the sale of natural gas, oil and natural
gas liquids, respectively.  

  In
fiscal 2006, Barnwell s net production after royalties for natural gas averaged
9,940 MCF per day, a slight increase from 9,920 MCF per day in fiscal
2005.  Gross natural gas production also
increased 1% in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005.  Dunvegan contributed approximately 50% of Barnwell s
net natural gas production in fiscal 2006, an   increase   from 48% in
fiscal 2005 due to the new wells drilled at Dunvegan.  

  Barnwell s
major oil producing properties are the Red Earth, Chauvin and Bonanza/Balsam
areas in Canada.  In fiscal 2006, net
production after royalties for oil averaged 400 barrels per day, an   

8     

increase
of 5% from 380 barrels per day in fiscal 2005. 
This increase was principally due to the addition of new wells in the
Wood River and Progress areas which offset decreased production from the
Bonanza/Balsam and Red Earth areas caused by natural declines from existing
wells.  

  In
fiscal 2006, net production after royalties for natural gas liquids averaged
320 barrels per day, an increase of 3% from 310 barrels per day in fiscal 2005.  This increase was due to higher Dunvegan
production which increased   8% or 19   barrels per
day.  Dunvegan contributed approximately   87%   of Barnwell s
net natural gas liquids production in fiscal 2006.  

  The average production cost per MCFE was
$1.45 for fiscal 2006, a 21% increase from $1.20 for fiscal 2005.  Actual field costs increased by 12% due to
industry-wide increases in costs for oilfield services and utilities in Canada
and a 7% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the
U.S. dollar in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005.  

  The
average depletion cost per MCFE was   $2.17   for fiscal
2006, a   31% increase   from $1.66
for fiscal 2005.  The increase was due to
a   22% increase   in the
depletion rate and a 7% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian
dollar to the U.S. dollar.  The 22%
increase in the depletion rate was due to an increase in Barnwell s costs of
finding and developing new proven reserves, and costs that are incurred to
maintain production from existing reserves. 
Barnwell s cost of finding and developing proven reserves has increased
as the costs of oil and natural gas exploration and development has increased
in Canada, and increased capital costs attributed to existing reserves.  

  In
fiscal 2005, approximately 68%, 21% and 11% of Barnwell s oil and natural gas
revenues were from the sale of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids,
respectively.  

  In
fiscal 2005, Barnwell s net production after royalties for natural gas averaged
9,920 MCF per day, an increase of 7% from 9,240 MCF per day in fiscal
2004.  Gross natural gas production also
increased 7% in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004.  Dunvegan contributed approximately 48% of Barnwell s
net natural gas production in fiscal 2005, an increase from 44% in fiscal 2004
due to the new well drilling at Dunvegan.  

  In
fiscal 2005, net production after royalties for oil averaged 380 barrels per
day, a decrease of 10% from 420 barrels per day in fiscal 2004.  This decrease was principally due to natural
production declines at Red Earth.  

  In
fiscal 2005, net production after royalties for natural gas liquids averaged
310 barrels per day, an increase of 7% from 290 barrels per day in fiscal
2004.  This increase was due to higher
Dunvegan production which increased 12% or 29 barrels per day.  Dunvegan contributed approximately 82% of
Barnwell s net natural gas liquids production in fiscal 2005.  

  The
average production cost per MCFE was $1.20 for fiscal 2005, an 8% increase from
$1.11 for fiscal 2004.  The increase was
due to an 8% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to
the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004.  

  The
average depletion cost per MCFE was $1.66 for fiscal 2005, a 27% increase from
$1.31 for fiscal 2004.  The increase was due
to a 17% increase in the depletion rate and an 8% increase in the average
exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar.

Productive
Wells   

The following table sets
forth the gross and net number of productive wells Barnwell has an interest in
as of September 30, 2006.  

*                          Twenty-four
natural gas wells have dual or multiple completions. 

  **                   Please see note
(2) on the following table. 

   Developed
Acreage and Undeveloped Acreage   

  The
following table sets forth certain information with respect to oil and natural
gas properties of Barnwell as of September 30, 2006.  

(1)                    Developed Acreage 
includes the acres covered by leases upon which there are one or more producing
wells.   Undeveloped Acreage  includes
acres covered by leases upon which there are no producing wells and which are
maintained in effect by the payment of delay rentals or the commencement of
drilling thereon. 

  (2)                     Gross  also
refers to the total number of acres or wells in which Barnwell owns an
interest, and  Net  refers to Barnwell s aggregate interest therein.  For example, a 50% interest in a 320 acre
lease represents 320 gross acres and 160 net acres.  The gross acreage and well figures include
interests owned of record by Barnwell and, in addition, the portion owned by
others.  

  Barnwell s
leasehold interests in its undeveloped acreage expire over the next fiscal
years, if not developed, as follows: 7% expire during fiscal 2007; 14  %   expire
during fiscal 2008; 28% expire during fiscal 2009; 25% expire during fiscal
2010; and 15% expire during fiscal 2011. 
Eleven percent of Barnwell s undeveloped acreage is related to heavy oil
and therefore not subject to expiration. 
There can be no assurance that Barnwell will be successful in renewing its
leasehold interests in the event of expiration.  

10     

Barnwell s
undeveloped acreage includes major concentrations in Alberta, at  Bremner (8,640 net acres), Doris (7,392 net
acres), Bonanza/Balsam (6,960 net acres), Boundary Lake (6,656 net acres),
Swalwell (6,316 net acres), Thornbury (6,261 net acres), Mulligan (5,236 net
acres), and Paddle River (5,184 net acres). 

   Reserves   

  The
amounts set forth in the table below, prepared by Paddock Lindstrom  
Associates Ltd., Barnwell s independent reservoir engineering consultants,
summarize the estimated net quantities of proved producing reserves and proved
reserves of crude oil (including condensate and natural gas liquids) and
natural gas as of September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004 on all properties in
which Barnwell has an interest.  These
reserves are before deductions for indebtedness secured by the properties and
are based on constant dollars.  No
estimates of total proved net oil or natural gas reserves have been filed with
or included in reports to any federal authority or agency, other than the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission, since October 1, 2004.  

   Proved Producing Reserves   

Total Proved
Reserves 
   (Includes Proved Producing Reserves)   

11     

As
of September 30, 2006, essentially all of Barnwell s proved producing and
total proved reserves were located in the Province of Alberta, with minor
volumes located in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and British Columbia.  

  During
fiscal 2006, Barnwell s total net proved reserves, including proved producing
reserves, of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids   decreased
by 3,000 barrels, and total net proved reserves of natural gas decreased by
408,000 MCF.  

  The
change in oil, condensate and natural gas liquids reserves during fiscal 2006
was the net result of production during the year of   260,000   barrels,
the   addition of 190,000   barrels
from the drilling of wells, the independent engineer s 91,000 upward revision
of Barnwell s oil reserves and a decrease of 24,000 barrels due to elimination
of the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit program effective January 1, 2007.  See the  Governmental Regulation  section
herewith for further discussion on the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit program.  

  The
change in natural gas reserves during fiscal 2006 was the net result of
production during the year of 3,629,000 MCF, the addition of 4,464,000 MCF from
the drilling of natural gas wells, the independent engineer s 865,000 MCF
downward revision of Barnwell s natural gas reserves and a decrease of 378,000
MCF due to the elimination of the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit program.    

  Barnwell s
working interest in the Dunvegan area accounted for approximately 49% and 55%
of its total proved natural gas reserves at September 30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, and approximately 33% and 37% of total proved oil and natural gas
liquids reserves at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.   

  The
following table sets forth Barnwell s oil and natural gas reserves at
September 30, 2006, by property name, based on information prepared by
Paddock Lindstrom   Associates Ltd. 
Gross reserves are before the deduction of royalties; net reserves are
after the deduction of royalties.  This
table is based on constant dollars where reserve estimates are based on sales
prices, costs and statutory tax rates in existence at the date of the
projection.  Oil, which includes natural
gas liquids ( NGL ), is shown in thousands of barrels ( MBBLS ) and natural gas
is shown in millions of cubic feet ( MMCF ).

OIL AND NATURAL GAS
RESERVES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006  

Estimated
Future Net Revenues   

  The
following table sets forth Barnwell s  Estimated Future Net Revenues  from
total proved oil, natural gas and condensate reserves and the present value of
Barnwell s  Estimated Future Net Revenues  (discounted at 10%).  Estimated future net revenues for total
proved reserves are net of estimated development costs.  Net revenues have been calculated using
current sales prices and costs, after deducting all royalties, operating costs,
future estimated capital expenditures, and income taxes.  

*                    These amounts do
not purport to represent, nor should they be interpreted as, the fair value of
Barnwell s natural gas and oil reserves. 
An estimate of fair value would also consider, among other items, the
value of Barnwell s undeveloped land position, the recovery of reserves not
presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in oil and natural
gas prices (these amounts were based on a natural gas price of $3.34 per 1,000
cubic feet as of September 30, 2006) and costs, and a discount factor more
representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in reserve
estimates.

Marketing
of Oil and Natural Gas   

  Barnwell
sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under
short-term contracts between itself and marketers of oil.  The price of oil and natural gas liquids is
freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers and is largely determined by
the world price for oil, which is principally denominated in U.S. dollars.  

  Natural
gas sold by Barnwell is generally sold under both long-term and short-term
contracts with prices indexed to market prices. 
The price of natural gas and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated
between buyers and sellers and is principally determined for Barnwell by the
North American price for natural gas, which is principally denominated in U.S.
dollars.  In fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004,
Barnwell took virtually all of its oil and natural gas  in kind  where Barnwell
markets the products instead of having the operator of a producing property
market the products on Barnwell s behalf.  

  In
fiscal 2006, natural gas production from the Dunvegan Unit was responsible for
approximately 50% of Barnwell s natural gas revenues, as compared to 46% in
fiscal 2005.  In fiscal 2006, Barnwell
had   four  
individually significant marketers that accounted for 69% of Barnwell s oil and
natural gas revenues.  A substantial
portion of Barnwell s Dunvegan natural gas production and natural gas
production from other properties is sold to aggregators and marketers under
various short-term and long-term contracts, with the price of natural gas
determined by negotiations between the aggregators and the final purchasers.  In fiscal 2006, over 90% of Barnwell s oil
and natural gas revenues were from products sold at spot prices.  

   Governmental
Regulation   

  The
jurisdictions in which the oil and natural gas properties of Barnwell are
located have regulatory provisions relating to permits for the drilling of
wells, the spacing of wells, the prevention of oil and natural gas waste,
allowable rates of production and other matters.  The amount of oil and natural gas produced is
subject to control by regulatory agencies in each province that periodically
assign allowable rates of production. 
The Province of Alberta and Government of Canada also monitor and
regulate the volume of natural gas that may be removed from the province and
the conditions of removal.  

  There
is no current government regulation of the price that may be charged on the
sale of Canadian oil or natural gas production. 
Canadian natural gas production destined for export is priced by market
forces subject to export contracts meeting certain criteria prescribed by
Canada s National Energy Board and the Government of Canada.   

  Different
royalty rates are imposed by the provincial governments, the Government of
Canada and private interests with respect to the production and sale of crude
oil, natural gas and liquids.  In addition,
provincial governments receive additional revenue through the imposition of
taxes on crude oil and natural gas owned by private interests within the
province.  Essentially, provincial
royalties are calculated as a percentage of revenue and vary depending on
production volumes, selling prices and the date of discovery.  

  In
2002, Canadian taxpayers were not permitted to deduct royalties, taxes, rentals
and similar levies paid to the federal or provincial governments in connection
with oil and natural gas production in computing income for Canadian federal
income tax purposes.  However, they were
allowed to deduct a  Resource Allowance  which is 25% of the taxpayer s  Resource
Profits for the Year    

14     

(essentially, net
income from the production of oil, natural gas or minerals) in computing their
taxable income.  In November 2003, Royal
Assent was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada, which was
then enacted into law, to reduce Canada s corporate tax rate on  resource 
income (income derived from oil and natural gas operations) over a four-year
period beginning January 1, 2003 from 29% to 21% with the 21% tax rate
commencing on January 1, 2007. 
Additionally, the bill phases in over the same four-year period tax
deductions for royalties, which previously were not tax deductible, and phases
out the Resource Allowance deduction along with other changes.  Accordingly, during fiscal 2004, Barnwell s
Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were reduced by approximately
$1,440,000 due to the reduction in Canada s federal corporate tax rate.  Barnwell s Canadian net deferred income tax
liabilities were also reduced by approximately $300,000 in fiscal 2004 as a
result of the Province of Alberta s reduction of the province s corporate tax
rate from 13.0% to 12.5%, effective April 1, 2003 (enacted into law in
December 2003), and from 12.5% to 11.5%, effective April 1, 2004 (enacted
into law in May 2004).  

  In
May 2006, a bill reducing the Province of Alberta s corporate tax rate from
11.5% to 10.0% effective April 1, 2006 received Royal Assent and was
passed into law.  In June 2006, Royal
Assent was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada which reduces
the federal corporate income tax rate to 19% from 21% by 2010 starting
January 1, 2008.  The federal
corporate surtax will also be eliminated effective January 1, 2008.  During the year ended September 30,
2006, Barnwell s Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were reduced by
approximately $1,094,000 as a result of these reductions in Canadian tax rates.

In
Alberta, a producer of oil or natural gas is entitled to a credit against the
royalties payable to Alberta called the Alberta Royalty Tax Credit ( ARTC ).  The ARTC has been discontinued by the Alberta
government effective January 1, 2007. 
Barnwell received ARTC payments of $438,000, $409,000 and $377,000 in
fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 
The ARTC payments were recorded as a credit against oil and natural gas
royalties and reported in oil and natural gas revenues.  In fiscal 2007, Barnwell expects to receive
ARTC payments of approximately $100,000, representing the ARTC for the period
from October 1, 2006 to December 31, 2006.  Beginning January 1, 2007, Barnwell will
no longer receive ARTC payments.  

   Competition   

  The majority
of Barnwell s natural gas sales take place in Alberta, Canada.  Natural gas prices in Alberta are generally
competitive with other major North American areas due to increased pipeline
capacity into the United States. 
Barnwell s oil and natural gas liquids are sold in Alberta with prices
determined by the world price for oil.  

  Barnwell
competes in the sale of oil and natural gas on the basis of price, and on the
ability to deliver products.  The oil and
natural gas industry is intensely competitive in all phases, including the
exploration for new production and reserves and the acquisition of equipment
and labor necessary to conduct drilling activities.  The competition comes from numerous major oil
companies as well as numerous other independent operators.  There is also competition between the oil and
natural gas industry and other industries in supplying the energy and fuel
requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers.  Barnwell is a minor participant in the
industry and competes in its oil and natural gas activities with many other
companies having far greater financial, technical and other resources.

Land
Investment Segment   

   Overview   

  Barnwell owns a 77.6% controlling interest in
Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general partnership which owns interests in
leasehold land and development rights for property located approximately six
miles north of the Kona International Airport in the North Kona District of the
island of Hawaii.  

   Operations   

  Between 1986 and 1989, Kaupulehu Developments obtained
the state and county zoning changes necessary to permit development of the Four
Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which
opened in 1996, a second golf course, and single-family and multi-family
residential units.  These projects were
developed on leasehold land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments by Kaupulehu
Makai Venture, an unrelated entity.  The
development rights held by Kaupulehu Developments are for residentially-zoned
leasehold land within and adjacent to the two golf courses and are under option
to Kaupulehu Makai Venture.  

  Kaupulehu Developments later obtained the state and
county zoning changes necessary to permit development of single-family and
multi-family residential units, a golf course and a limited commercial area on
approximately 870 leasehold acres located adjacent to and north of the Four
Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka upulehu.  

  In
February 2004, Kaupulehu Developments entered into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement with WB KD Acquisition, LLC ( WB ) by which Kaupulehu Developments
transferred its leasehold interest in the aforementioned 870 acres zoned for
resort/residential development, in two increments, to WB.  There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu
Developments and WB.  WB is affiliated
with Westbrook Partners, the developers of the nearby Kuki o Resort.  The first increment ( Increment I ) is
an area planned for approximately 80 single-family lots and a beach club on the
portion of the property bordering the Pacific Ocean.  The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots
will have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki o Resort Golf and Beach
Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort
Hualalai at Historic Ka upulehu.  The
second increment ( Increment II ) is the remaining portion of the
approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and multi-family
residential units and a golf course and clubhouse.  

  With respect to Increment I, Kaupulehu
Developments received an $11,550,000 payment in February 2004 and is entitled
to receive payment of the following percentages of the gross proceeds generated
from the sale by WB of single-family lots in Increment I ( Percentage Payments ):
9% of the gross proceeds from single-family lot sales up to aggregate gross
proceeds of $100,000,000; 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than
$100,000,000 but less than $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross
proceeds in excess of $300,000,000. 
Minimum amounts of these Percentage Payments are due by certain
dates.  There is no assurance that any
future payments will be received.    

16     

WB
also agreed to pay Kaupulehu Developments subsequent to February 2004 interim
payments of $50,000 per month ( Interim Payments ) up to a total of
$900,000.  Kaupulehu Developments
received the $900,000 in full as of August 2005.  

   Activity   

  WB
sold the first of the 80 single-family lots under development in
Increment I in January 2006.  Two
additional lots were sold by WB in February 2006 and another two lots were sold
in April 2006, bringing total lot sales in fiscal 2006 to five lots.  Kaupulehu Developments received Percentage
Payments totaling $3,660,000 for these five lot sales.  Revenue from the Percentage Payments was
reduced by $220,000 of fees related to the sales, resulting in net revenues of
$3,440,000 and a $2,688,000 operating profit, after minority interest.  There is no assurance that any future
payments will be received.   

  In
June 2006, Kaupulehu Developments entered into an Agreement ( Increment II
Agreement ) with WB and WB KD Acquisition II, LLC ( WBKD ) by which Kaupulehu
Developments sold its interest in Increment II, representing the remainder
of the approximately 870 acres, to WBKD. 
There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu Developments and WB or WBKD.  WB and WBKD are both affiliates of Westbrook
Partners, developers of the nearby Kuki o Resort.  Pursuant to the Increment II Agreement,
Kaupulehu Developments received a $10,000,000 payment and is entitled to
receive future payments from WBKD based on a percentage of the sales prices of
the residential lots, ranging from 3.25% to 14%, to be determined in the future
depending upon a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior
to improvement.  The revenue from the
$10,000,000 payment was reduced by $600,000 of fees related to the sale,
$220,000 in other costs related to the sale, and approximately $2,983,000 of
previously capitalized costs relating to Increment II, resulting in net
revenues of $6,197,000 and a $4,621,000 operating profit, after minority
interest.  There is no assurance that any
future payments will be received.  

  In
addition, under the terms of the Increment II Agreement, WBKD has the
exclusive right to negotiate with Kaupulehu Developments with respect to Lot
4C, which is comprised of approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land
zoned conservation located adjacent to Increment II.  This right expires in June 2009 or, if before
such date WBKD completes any and all environmental assessments and surveys
reasonably required to support a petition to the Hawaii State Land Use
Commission for reclassification of Lot 4C zoning, in June 2012.  

  In November 2005,
Kaupulehu Makai Venture paid Kaupulehu Developments a non-refundable payment of
$2,875,000, consisting of $2,656,250 for the exercise of its development rights
option due on December 31, 2005 and $218,750 for a portion of its
development rights option due on December 31, 2006.    The
$2,875,000 of option proceeds was reduced by $173,000 of fees related to the
sale, resulting in net revenues of $2,702,000 and a $2,111,000 operating
profit, after minority interest.  There
were no other costs deducted from revenues from the sale of development rights
in fiscal 2006 as all capitalized costs associated with the development rights
were expensed in previous years.  

  The total amount of remaining future development
rights option receipts at September 30, 2006, if all options are fully
exercised, is $13,062,500, comprised of the balance of $2,437,500 due on
December 31, 2006 and four payments of $2,656,250 due on each
December 31 of years 2007 to 2010.    

17     

If any annual option payment is not made,
the then remaining development right options will expire.  There is no assurance that any portion of the
remaining options will be exercised.  

  The interests held by Kaupulehu Developments at
September 30, 2006 include the development rights under option, the rights
to receive percentage of sales payments, and approximately 1,000 acres of
vacant leasehold land zoned conservation, which is under a right of negotiation
with WBKD.  

   Competition   

  Barnwell s
land investment segment is subject to intense competition in all phases of its
operations including the acquisition of new properties, the securing of
approvals necessary for land rezoning, and the search for potential buyers of
property interests presently owned.  The
competition comes from numerous independent land development companies and
other industries involved in land investment activities.  The principal factors affecting competition
are the location of the project and pricing. 
Kaupulehu Developments is a minor participant in the land development
industry and competes in its land investment activities with many other
entities having far greater financial and other resources.  

  For
the past few years, Hawaii s economy has experienced positive growth and the
South Kohala/North Kona area of the island of Hawaii, the area in which
Kaupulehu Developments  property is located, has experienced strong demand for
residential real estate.  This trend
continued through fiscal 2006, but at a diminished rate, and, although we
cannot be certain, it is not expected to decline significantly in the near
term, although there can be no assurance this trend will in fact continue.  The price and market for real estate in the
South Kohala/North Kona area of the island of Hawaii has historically been
cyclical and if the demand for real estate in the area Kaupulehu Developments 
interests are located were to decrease, Barnwell s operating results could be
negatively affected.  During periods when
demand for real estate is low, inventory may turn at slower rates than expected
or may be sold at prices lower than anticipated.  This could potentially impair Barnwell s
liquidity and impede its ability to proceed with other planned projects or
activities.  

   Contract Drilling Segment   

   Overview   

  Barnwell s wholly-owned subsidiary, Water
Resources International, Inc. ( Water Resources ), drills water, water
monitoring and geothermal wells of varying depths in Hawaii, installs and
repairs water pumping systems, and is the state of Hawaii s distributor for
Floway pumps and equipment.  

   Operations   

  Water Resources owns and operates three
Spencer-Harris portable rotary drill rigs ranging in drilling capacity from
3,500 feet to 7,000 feet, an IDECO H-35 rotary drill/workover rig and pump
installation and service equipment. 
Additionally, Water Resources leases a three-quarter of an acre
maintenance facility in Honolulu, Hawaii and a one acre maintenance and storage
facility with 2,800 square feet of interior space in Kawaihae, Hawaii, and
maintains an inventory of drilling materials and   

18     

pump supplies.  As of September 30, 2006, Water
Resources employed 21 drilling, pump and administrative employees, none of whom
are union members.    

  The demand for Water Resources  services is
primarily dependent upon land development activities in Hawaii.  Water Resources markets its services to land
developers and government agencies, and identifies potential contracts through
public notices, its officers  involvement in community activities and
referrals.  Contracts are usually fixed
price per lineal foot drilled or day rate contracts and are negotiated with
private entities or obtained through competitive bidding with private entities
or local, state and federal agencies.  Contract
revenues are not dependent upon the discovery of water, geothermal production
zones or other similar targets, and contracts are not subject to renegotiation
of profits or termination at the election of the governmental entities
involved.  Contracts provide for
arbitration in the event of disputes.  

  Water Resources derived 37%, 63%, and 70% of its
contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively,
pursuant to federal, State of Hawaii and county contracts.  At September 30, 2006, Barnwell had
accounts receivable from the State of Hawaii and county entities totaling
approximately $754,000.  Barnwell has
lien rights on wells drilled and pumps installed for federal, State of Hawaii,
county and private entities.  

  Water Resources currently operates in Hawaii and
is not subject to seasonal fluctuations.  

   Activity   

  In
fiscal 2006, Water Resources started six well drilling contracts and four pump
installation contracts and completed 11 well drilling contracts and six pump
installation contracts.  Seven of the
completed well drilling contracts and three of the completed pump installation
contracts were started in the prior year. 
Fifty-two percent (52%) of well drilling and pump installation jobs,
representing 37% of total contract drilling revenues in fiscal 2006, have been
pursuant to government contracts.  

  At
September 30, 2006, Water Resources had a backlog of four well drilling
contracts and nine pump installation and repair contracts, of which four, two
well drilling and two pump installation and repair, were in progress as of
September 30, 2006.    

  The
dollar amount of Water Resources  backlog of firm well drilling and pump
installation and repair contracts at November 30, 2006 and 2005 was as
follows:  

All
of the contracts in backlog at November 30, 2006 are expected to be
completed within fiscal year 2007.  

19     

Competition   

  Water
Resources utilizes rotary drill rigs and competes with other drilling
contractors in Hawaii which use drill rigs similar to Water Resources  drilling
rigs or drilling rigs that drill as quickly as Water Resources  equipment but
require less labor.  These competitors
are also capable of installing and repairing vertical turbine and submersible
water pumping systems in Hawaii.  These
contractors compete actively with Water Resources for government and private
contracts.  Pricing is Water Resources 
major method of competition; reliability of service is also a significant
factor.  

  Competitive
pressures are expected to remain high, thus there is no assurance that the
quantity of available or awarded jobs which occurred in fiscal 2006 will
continue.  

   Summary Financial Information For all Industry
Segments

   ITEM 1A.               RISK
FACTORS     

  The business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face
numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in
this Form 10-K or in Barnwell s other filings with the SEC.  The risks described below are not the only
risks that Barnwell faces, nor are they necessarily listed in order of
significance.  

   Risks Related to Oil and Gas Segment   

    The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.    

  We compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves,
undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and
other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline and refining
capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other
organizations, many of which may have greater technical and financial resources
than we do.  Some of these organizations
explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations
and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis.  As a result of these complementary
activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are
greater and more diverse than ours. 
Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage
when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas
production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and
availability of alternative fuels and the application of government
regulations.  If our competitors are able
to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our
revenues.  

    Our results of operations and financial condition are dependent on the
prices received for our oil and natural gas production.    

  Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have
fluctuated widely during recent years in response to many factors that are
beyond our control.  These factors
include, but are not limited to, minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty,
worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the
level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes,  

21     

the
price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic
environment.  Any decline in crude oil or
natural gas prices may have a material adverse effect on our operations,
financial condition, borrowing ability, reserves and amount of capital that we
are able to allocate for the development of oil and natural gas reserves.  

  Energy
prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our
control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting
oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United
States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.  

    An increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition.    

  Higher
operating costs for our underlying properties will directly decrease the amount
of cash flow received by us and, therefore, may reduce the price of our common
stock.  Electricity, supplies, and labor
costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation.  

  The
level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater
than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances, many of which are beyond our
control.  A significant decline in our
production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow.  

    Our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and
natural gas that we produce.    

  Our
business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of gas
gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.  Canadian federal and provincial, as well as
United States federal and state, regulation of oil and gas production,
processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic
conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability
to produce and market oil and natural gas. 
If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production,
overall production or realized prices may decline.  

   Our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government
regulation and other risks, particularly in the United States and Canada.   

  Barnwell s
oil and gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and
regulations, particularly in the United States and Canada, such as restrictions
on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of
specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of
property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls,
environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers  health
and safety.  Further, the right to
explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan
and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those
provinces.  Changes in royalties and
other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a
substantial effect on Barnwell s operations. 
 We derive a
significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada.  In fiscal 2006, we derived approximately 66%
of our operating revenues from operations in Canada. 

  Additionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian
oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental
regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to  

22     

contractors in which Canadian nationals have
substantial ownership interests. 
Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees
from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S.  

  Government regulations
control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive
requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution
control and remediation of environmental contamination.  Environmental regulations, in particular,
prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment
and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or
fault.  In addition, governmental
regulations may discourage our customers  activities, reducing demand for our
products and services.  

   Compliance
with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.   

  Tax and other laws and
regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and
national authorities.  It is also
possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation
and other matters in Canada, and these disputes could have a material adverse
effect on our financial performance.  

    We are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and gas
to maintain our reserves.    

  We actively explore for oil
and natural gas reserves.  However,
future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve
substantial costs.  Despite this
uncertainty or potential cost, discoveries or acquisitions of additional
reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and
production.  As a result, future oil and
natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing
properties and acquiring additional reserves. 
If our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable, our ability to
make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas
reserves will be impaired.  Additionally,
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional
reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives.  Without these reserve additions, our reserves
will deplete and as a consequence, either production from, or the average
reserve life of, our properties will decline.  

    Actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates.    

  The value of our common stock
depends upon, among other things, the level of reserves of oil and gas.  Estimating reserves is inherently uncertain,
and the figures herein are only estimates. 
Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary
from estimates, and those variations may be material.  The estimation of reserves involves a number
of factors and assumptions, including, among others:  

                        historical production in the area compared
with production rates from similar producing areas; 

                        future commodity prices, production and
development costs, royalties and capital expenditures; 

                        initial production rates; 

                        production decline rates; 

                        ultimate recovery of reserves; 

                        success of future development activities; 

                        marketability of production; 

23     

effects of government regulation; and 

                        other government levies that may be imposed
over the producing life of reserves. 

  Reserve estimates are based
on the relevant factors, assumptions and prices as of the date on which the
evaluations are prepared.  Many of these
factors are subject to change and are beyond our control.  If these factors, assumptions and prices
prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve
estimates.  

    Delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions.    

  In addition to the usual
delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our
properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us,
payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by:  

                        restrictions imposed by lenders; 

                        accounting delays; 

                        delays in the sale or delivery of products; 

                        delays in the connection of wells to a
gathering system; 

                        blowouts or other accidents; 

                        adjustments for prior periods; 

                        recovery by the operator of expenses incurred
in the operation of the properties; or 

                        the establishment by the operator of reserves
for these expenses. 

  Any of these delays could
expose us to additional third party credit risks.  

    The industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities
that may not be covered by insurance.    

  Our operations are subject
to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and
natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells,
and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas.  These risks include encountering unexpected
formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment
failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable
flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions,
pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills.  A number of these risks could result in
personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our
property or the property of others.  

  While we maintain reserves
for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance, we could be
affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or
proceedings.  We cannot fully protect
against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks
insurable.  There is no assurance that
any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect
us against liability for the risks listed above.  We could face substantial losses, if an event
occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against, or a
customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance
obligations.  In addition, there can be
no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all
of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs
will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such
insurance prohibitive.  

24     

We may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health,
safety, and environmental laws and regulations.    

  The oil and natural gas
industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local,
provincial and federal legislation.  A
violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance
of  clean up  orders.  Legislation
regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher
standards and potentially more costly obligations.  For example, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the
United Nation s Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto
Protocol, was ratified by the Canadian government in December 2002 and will
require, among other things, significant reductions in greenhouse gases.  The impact of the Kyoto Protocol on us is
uncertain and may result in significant additional costs for our future
operations.  Although we record a
provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future
environmental and reclamation obligations, we cannot guarantee that we will be
able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations.  

  We are not fully insured
against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not
available or because of high premium costs. 
In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring
over time (as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages) is not available on
economically reasonable terms. 
Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred
in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact
our cash flow.  Should we be unable to
fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required
to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending
completion of the required remedy.  

   We may have difficulty financing our planned capital expenditures,
which could have an adverse affect on our business.   

  We make and will continue to
make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development
projects.  Without additional capital
resources, our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business,
financial condition and results of operations may suffer.  We may not be able to secure additional
financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available
to us under our existing financing arrangements.  If additional capital resources are
unavailable, we may curtail our drilling, development and other activities or
be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms.  Any such curtailment or sale could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operation.  

   Unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to
production and reserves.   

  Although we conduct title
reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource
assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in
the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased
assets.  If such a defect were to occur,
our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be
jeopardized.  

25     

Changes in tax and other legislation may adversely affect shareholders.    

  Income tax laws, other
legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and gas
industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely
affects us and our shareholders.  Tax
authorities having jurisdiction over us may disagree with the manner in which
we calculate our income for tax purposes or could change their administrative
practices to our detriment.  

   Risks Related to Real Estate Investment Segment   

   Significant competition in the
real estate industry could have an adverse effect on our business.   

  We face competition from
other developers on the island of Hawaii, and from other luxury residential
properties in Hawaii and the mainland United States.  In many cases, our competitors have greater
financial and other resources than us. 
If we are unable to compete with these larger competitors, our financial
results could be adversely affected.  

   A downturn in economic conditions
and demand for real estate could adversely affect our business.   

  The real estate investment
industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in
local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such
as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job
growth and property taxes.  As a result,
revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly.  

  Considerable economic and
political uncertainties currently exist that could have adverse effects on
consumer buying habits, construction costs, availability of labor and materials
and other factors affecting us and the real estate industry in general.  Significant expenditures associated with
investment in real estate, such as real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance
costs and debt payments, cannot generally be reduced even though changes in
Hawaii s or the nation s economy may cause a decrease in revenues from our
properties.  

   Our real estate business is
primarily concentrated in the state of Hawaii. 
As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth
and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii.   

  Barnwell s land investment
business segment is affected by the condition of Hawaii s real estate market.  The Hawaii real estate market is affected by
Hawaii s economy and Hawaii s tourism industry, as well as the United States 
economy in general.  Any future cash
flows from Barnwell s land development activities are subject to, among other
factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new
housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the
cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code
modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii s
economy.  The future economic growth in
certain portions of the island of Hawaii may be adversely affected if its
infrastructure, such as roads, airports, medical facilities and schools, are
not improved to meet increased demand. 
There can be no assurance that these improvements will occur.  

26     

The occurrence of natural
disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.   

  The occurrence of natural
disasters in Hawaii could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects.  The occurrence of natural disasters could
also cause increases in property and flood insurance rates and deductibles,
which could reduce demand for our properties.  

   Increases in interest rates could
reduce demand for our real estate.   

  Continued increases in
interest rates could reduce the demand for development, particularly land.  Increased interest rates could also
negatively impact pricing for our products. 
A reduction in demand or pricing would materially adversely affect our
profitability.  

   Our business is subject to
extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct
our operations.   

  We are subject to a wide
variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to land use
and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations,
including those related to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal
of hazardous materials.  Any failure to
comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the
imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could
adversely affect present and future operations, or jeopardize our ability to
sell the leasehold interest currently held.  

   A portion of future percentage of sales payments could be impaired if
the developer of the property is unable to negotiate fee simple interests.   

  In 2006 we sold our
leasehold interest in the second of two increments of resort/residential zoned
property to an unrelated developer.  As a
part of the sale, we are entitled to receive future payments based on a
percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold in this second
increment.  Receipt of these percentage
of sales payments will be contingent upon the ability of the developer of the
leasehold interest in the resort/residential zoned property to successfully
negotiate fee simple prices within this second increment.  If the developer is unsuccessful in such
negotiations, our ability to receive percentage of sales payments on the sales
of those lots would be impaired.  

   If we are unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable
costs, or at all, our operating results could be adversely affected.   

  We hold the leasehold
interest to approximately 1,000 acres of vacant land that is currently zoned
conservation.  Our success in selling
this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification
from the State of Hawaii Land Use Commission and County of Hawaii.  Obtaining the necessary reclassification and
ministerial approvals is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or
more, to complete.  Delays or failures to
obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our
financial results.  

27     

Environmental and other
regulations may have an adverse effect on our business.   

  Our properties are subject
to federal, state and local environmental regulations and restrictions that may
impose significant limitations.  In most
cases, approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long,
uncertain and costly regulatory process.  

   We are involved in joint ventures
and are subject to risks associated with joint venture partnerships.   

  We are involved in joint
venture relationships and may initiate future joint venture projects.  Entering into a joint venture involves
certain risks which include:  

                        the inability to exercise voting control over
the joint venture; 

                        economic or business interests which are not
aligned with our venture partner; and 

                        the inability for the venture partner to fulfill
its commitments and obligations due to financial or other difficulties. 

   Risks Related to Contract
Drilling Segment   

   Demand for water well drilling
and/or pump installation is volatile.  A
decrease in demand for our services would result in a decrease in our revenues.   

  Demand for services is
highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii.  As also noted above, the real estate
investment industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to
shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our
control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment
levels and job growth and property taxes. 
If we experience a decrease in water well drilling and/or pump
installation contracts, we may experience decreased revenues and operating
results.  

   A significant portion of our
contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in
municipal spending could adversely impact our business.   

  A significant portion of our
contract drilling water resources division revenues are derived from water and
infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies.  Reduced tax revenues in certain regions may
limit spending and new development by local municipalities which in turn will
affect the demand for our services in these regions.  Material reductions in spending by a
significant number of municipalities or local governmental agencies could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and
financial position.  

   Our contract drilling operations
face significant competition from companies with greater financial resources.   

  We face competition for our
services from a variety of competitors. 
Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as
our equipment but require less labor. 
Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree,
quality of service.  If we are unable to
compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be
adversely affected.  

28     

The loss of or damage to key
vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our
operations.   

  Our business is dependent on
our relationships with key vendors, customers and sub-contractors.  The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships
could negatively affect our business.  

   Entity-Wide Risks   

   The price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to
fluctuate substantially.   

  The market price of our
common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of
factors, including:  

                        fluctuations in commodity prices; 

                        variations in results of operations; 

                        announcements by us and our competitors; 

                        legislative or regulatory changes; 

                        general trends in the industry; 

                        general market conditions; and 

                        analysts  estimates and other events in the
oil and natural gas industry. 

   Failure
to retain key personnel could hurt our operations .    

  We require highly skilled
and experienced personnel to operate our business.  In addition to competing in highly
competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market.  Our business could be adversely affected by
an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the
highly competitive labor market.  

   A small
number of shareholders, including our executive officers, own a significant
amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of
the opposition of other shareholders.   

  As of September 30,
2006, three of our investors and our executive officers held approximately 60% of
our common stock.  The interests of these
shareholders may not always coincide with the interests of other
shareholders.  These shareholders, acting
together, have significant influence over all matters submitted to our
shareholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate,
delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us.  These shareholders are able to exercise
significant control over our business, policies and affairs.  

   We may
be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2007, which
we believe will result in additional expenses and may divert management s
attention.   

  The Company may become an
accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which would
require the Company to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
fiscal 2007.  In such event, management
would be required to provide with the Company s Annual Report on  

29     

Form 10-K for the year ending September 30,
2007, its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control
over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007 and our independent
registered public accounting firm would be required to provide its attestation
report on management s assessment.  If
such compliance is required, the Company anticipates incurring additional
general and administrative expenses and anticipates that its compliance efforts
may divert management s time and attention away from other aspects of our
business.  

   Adverse
changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to
economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely
affect Barnwell s results and financial condition.   

  Retirement plan cash funding
obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of
uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors,
including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity
markets, and the levels of interest rates.

  Barnwell is occasionally
involved in routine litigation and is subject to governmental and regulatory

  The
following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the
consolidated balance sheets of Barnwell Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries
(collectively referred to herein as  Barnwell ) as of September 30, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity
and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 2006. 
This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in this report.  

   Use of
Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities.  Actual results could differ
significantly from those estimates.  

   Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

  In
response to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8040,  Cautionary
Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,  Barnwell has
identified certain of its policies as being of particular importance to the
understanding of its financial position and results of operations and which
require the application of significant judgment by management.  

   Oil and natural
gas properties   

  Barnwell
uses the full cost method of accounting under which all costs incurred in the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves,
including costs related to unsuccessful wells and estimated future site
restoration and abandonment, are capitalized until such time as the aggregate
of such costs net of accumulated depletion and oil and gas related deferred
income taxes, on a country-by-country basis, equals the sum of 1) the discounted
present value (at 10%), using prices as of the end of the fiscal year on a
constant basis, of Barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated
production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as determined by independent
petroleum engineers, less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in
developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows
associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on the balance
sheet; plus 2) the cost of major development projects and unproven properties
not subject to depletion, if any; plus 3) the lower of cost or estimated fair
value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion; less 4)
related income tax effects.  If net
capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is expensed unless subsequent
market price changes eliminate or reduce the indicated write-down in accordance
with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic
12D.  Depletion is computed using the
units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs, net of salvage values,
plus estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and satisfy asset
retirement obligations, are amortized over the total estimated proved reserves
on a country-by-country basis.  Investments
in major development projects are not depleted until either proved reserves are
associated with the projects or impairment has been  

34     

determined.  At September 30, 2006 and 2005, Barnwell had
no investments in major oil and natural gas development projects that were not
being depleted.  General and
administrative costs related to oil and natural gas operations are expensed as
incurred.  Proceeds from the disposition
of minor producing oil and natural gas properties are credited to the cost of
oil and natural gas properties.  Gains or
losses are recognized on the disposition of significant oil and natural gas
properties.  

  Based
on a natural gas spot price of $3.34 per 1,000 cubic feet ( MCF ) as of
September 30, 2006, the full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation by
approximately $1,581,000.  However,
natural gas prices increased significantly subsequent to September 30,
2006, but prior to the filing of this annual report, such that Barnwell s full
cost pool would not have exceeded the ceiling limitation.  The spot price of natural gas on
December 18, 2006 was approximately $6.30 per MCF, which represents an 89%
increase over the September 30, 2006 spot price of $3.34 per MCF.  Accordingly, per U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12D, Barnwell has not recorded an
impairment write-down of its oil and natural gas properties at
September 30, 2006.  

   Investment in land
and revenue recognition   

  Barnwell s
investment in land is comprised of development rights under option, rights to
receive percentage of sales payments, and approximately 1,000 acres of vacant
leasehold land zoned conservation, which is under a right of negotiation.  Investment in land is reported at the lower
of the asset carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell, and is evaluated
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
recorded investment balance may not be fully recoverable.  

  Costs
incurred for the acquisition and improvement of sales of leasehold land
interests, including capitalized interest, are included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets under the caption  Investment in Land.   

  Sales
of development rights under option and revenues from sales of leasehold land
interests are accounted for pursuant to the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 66,  Accounting for Sales of
Real Estate.   SFAS No. 66 provides
specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sale revenue can be
recorded.  

   Investment in
affiliate   

  In June 2006, Barnwell
entered into an agreement with Nearco, Inc. ( Nearco ) to form Mauka 3K,
LLC ( Mauka 3K ), for the purpose of providing real estate consulting
services and investing in real estate.  Barnwell and Nearco each have an equal 50%
voting interest in Mauka 3K.  Nearco
is a company controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an
indirect 20.6% owner of Kaupulehu Developments, a general partnership in which
Barnwell owns a 77.6% controlling interest.  

  Barnwell has evaluated
the aforementioned investment in accordance with FASB Interpretation
No. 46,  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,  as revised, as well
as other applicable authoritative accounting literature, and has determined
that the investment in Mauka 3K does not meet the requirements for
consolidation.  Barnwell accounts for its
investment in unconsolidated affiliates under the equity method when Barnwell s
ownership interest is more than 20% but no more than 50% and Barnwell does not
exercise direct or indirect control over the investee.  Factors that are considered  

35     

in determining
whether or not Barnwell exercises control include rights of partners regarding
significant strategic and operational decisions.  As Barnwell does not exercise direct or
indirect control over Mauka 3K, the investment is accounted for using the
equity method of accounting.  

  Revenues from real estate
consulting services are recognized when services have been rendered and the
terms of the consulting agreement have been satisfied.  

   Contract drilling   

  Revenues,
costs and profits applicable to contract drilling contracts are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations using the percentage of completion
method, principally measured by the percentage of labor dollars incurred to
date for each contract to total estimated labor dollars for each contract.  Contract losses are recognized in full in the
period the losses are identified.  The
performance of drilling contracts may extend over more than one year and, in
the interim periods, estimates of total contract costs and profits are used to
determine revenues and profits earned for reporting the results of contract
drilling operations.  Revisions in the
estimates required by subsequent performance and final contract settlements are
included as adjustments to the results of operations in the period such
revisions and settlements occur. 
Contracts are normally less than one year in duration.  

   Income taxes   

  Deferred
income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.  

  A valuation allowance is
provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Barnwell has established a valuation allowance primarily for the U.S.
tax effect of deferred Canadian taxes, accrued expenses and state of Hawaii net
operating loss carryforwards which may not be realizable in future years as
there can be no assurance of any specific level of earnings or that the timing
of U.S. earnings will coincide with the payment of Canadian taxes to enable
Canadian taxes to be fully deducted (or recoverable) for U.S. tax purposes.  

  Net
deferred tax assets at September 30, 2006 of $5,429,000 consists of
$3,293,000 related to expenses accrued for book purposes but not for tax
purposes, $614,000 related to the excess of the cost basis of investment in
land for tax purposes over the cost basis of investment in land for book
purposes, and $1,522,000 for foreign tax credit carryforwards.  Canadian deferred tax assets related to
expenses accrued for book purposes but not for tax purposes are estimated to be
realized through future Canadian income tax deductions against future Canadian
oil and natural gas earnings.  U.S.
deferred tax assets related to expenses accrued for book purposes but not for
tax purposes and the excess of the cost basis of investment in land for tax
purposes over the cost basis of investment in land for book purposes are
estimated to be realized from deductions against future U.S. earnings from
sales of interests in leasehold land and land development rights.  Foreign tax credit carryforwards are
estimated to be utilized when U.S. federal income taxes otherwise due on
Canadian source income in a given  

36     

year
exceeds the foreign tax credit generated in that year.  The foreign tax credit carryforwards will expire
if not utilized in fiscal years 2012 through 2013.  The amount of deferred income tax assets
considered realizable may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are
reduced.  

   Retirement plans   

  Barnwell sponsors a
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of its
U.S. employees, with benefits based on years of service and the employee s
highest consecutive five-year average earnings. 
Additionally, Barnwell sponsors a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan,
a noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers certain
current and former employees of Barnwell for amounts exceeding the limits
allowed under the pension plan.  Barnwell
accounts for its retirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87,  Employers 
Accounting for Pensions,  which requires that amounts recognized in financial
statements be determined on an actuarial basis. 
SFAS No. 87 requires that the effects of the performance of the
pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on
Barnwell s computation of pension income (expense) be amortized over future
periods.  Any variances in the future
between the assumed rates utilized for actuarial purposes and the actual rates
experienced by the plan may materially affect Barnwell s results of operations
or financial condition.  

  During
and as of the end of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, Barnwell assumed an expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8% and an expected rate of future
annual compensation increases of 5%.  

  At
the end of each year, Barnwell determines the discount rate to be used to
calculate the present value of plan liabilities.  The discount rate is an estimate of the
current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively
settled at the end of the year.  In
estimating this rate, Barnwell looks to rates of return on high-quality,
fixed-income investments.  At September 30,
2006, Barnwell determined this rate to be 5.50% as compared to a discount rate
of 5.25% used at September 30, 2005.  

  Barnwell
made cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of $1,050,000,
$150,000 and $74,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The contribution in fiscal 2006 resulted in a
prepaid pension cost of $234,000 at September 30, 2006.  Barnwell recognized net periodic benefit costs
of $299,000, $249,000 and $168,000 during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, and Barnwell recorded an additional minimum pension liability of
$132,000 in fiscal 2005.  Barnwell s
accrued benefit cost at September 30, 2005 and 2004 was $517,000 and
$418,000, respectively.  

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans   an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).  
SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the over-funded or
under-funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a
multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial
position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which
the changes occur through comprehensive income. 
SFAS No. 158 also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan
assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year-end
statement of financial position (with limited exceptions).  Under SFAS No. 158, Barnwell will be
required to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement
plan and supplemental employee retirement plan and to provide the required
disclosures.  SFAS No. 158 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006.  If SFAS No. 158 were applied as of
September 30, 2006, Barnwell  

37     

would
have recognized an additional pension and other postretirement benefit
obligation of approximately $1,500,000 along with a corresponding decrease in
accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately $990,000, net of
$510,000 of deferred income tax benefits associated with the temporary
difference between pension and postretirement liabilities recognized for book
versus tax purposes.  

   Asset retirement obligation   

  Barnwell
accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143,
 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,  and FASB Interpretation
No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations - an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143,  which requires that the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the
period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be
made.  The asset retirement obligation
reflects Barnwell s obligation to plug and abandon natural gas and oil wells,
dismantle and remove related equipment and plants, and restore the properties
to a suitable condition at the end of oil and gas operations based on Barnwell s
net ownership interest in the properties. 
The asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value in the period
in which it is incurred along with a corresponding increase in the carrying
amount of the related asset.  Barnwell
has estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash outflows
required to settle abandonment and restoration liabilities.  The present value calculation includes
numerous estimates, assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of
liabilities, the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the
liability, what constitutes adequate restoration, inflation factors, credit
adjusted discount rates, and consideration of changes in legal, regulatory,
environmental and political environments. 
Barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil
and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of
oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related
reserves.  The liability is accreted at
the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating expense.  Abandonment and restoration cost estimates
are determined in conjunction with Barnwell s reserve engineers based on
historical information regarding costs incurred to abandon and restore similar
well sites, information regarding current market conditions and costs, and
knowledge of subject well sites and properties.  

   Share-based payments   

  Effective
October 1, 2005, Barnwell adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based
Payment,  for its share-based compensation plans.  Barnwell previously accounted for these plans
under the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion ( APB ) No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,  and
related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by SFAS
No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,  as amended by SFAS
No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation   Transition and
Disclosure.   

  Under
APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recorded for Barnwell s stock options
issued under the qualified plan.  The pro
forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share for qualified stock
options were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements.  Under APB No. 25, compensation expense for
non-qualified stock options with stock appreciation rights features were
recorded utilizing the market price of Barnwell s stock at each period-end to
determine the vested intrinsic value of the stock appreciation rights.  

38     

Barnwell
elected to use the modified prospective transition method to adopt SFAS
No. 123(R).  Under SFAS No. 123(R),
share-based compensation cost is measured at fair value.  Barnwell utilizes a closed-form valuation
model to determine the fair value of each option award.  Expected volatilities are based on the
historical volatility of Barnwell s stock over a period consistent with that of
the expected terms of the options.  The
expected terms of the options are estimated based on factors such as vesting
periods, contractual expiration dates, historical trends in Barnwell s stock
price, and historical exercise behavior. 
The risk-free rates for periods within the contractual life of the
options are based on the yields of U.S. Treasury instruments with terms
comparable to the estimated option terms.  

  As
of September 30, 2006, there was $944,000 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested equity-classified and
liability-classified share options.  That
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.  

   Long-lived assets   

  Long-lived
assets to be held and used, other than oil and natural gas properties, are
evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.  If the future cash flows expected to result
from use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized.  Such impairment loss is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset.  Long-lived assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the asset carrying value or fair value, less
cost to sell.  

  Drilling
rigs, premises and other property and equipment are depreciated using the
straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.  

   Environmental   

  Barnwell
is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.  These laws, which are constantly changing,
regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of
surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the
environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical
substances at various sites. 
Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on
their future economic benefit. 
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations and that have no future economic benefits are expensed.  Liabilities for expenditures of a noncapital
nature are recorded when environmental assessment and/or remediation is
probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  

   Contractual
Obligations   

  The following table lists the scheduled maturities of
long-term debt, estimating that Barnwell s credit facility with Royal Bank of
Canada will be renewed on each annual renewal date, currently April 30,
and scheduled minimum rental payments of non-cancelable operating leases for
office space and leasehold land:  

39     

There
is no assurance that the bank will in fact extend the term of the facility on
each renewal date or that the facility will be renewed at its current
amount.  The following table lists the
scheduled maturities of long-term debt assuming that the facility will not be
renewed on the next renewal date, April 30, 2007 (for which repayment, if
any, has been deferred until no sooner than October 1, 2007), and that
Barnwell then elects to convert the revolving facility to term status, and
scheduled minimum rental payments of non-cancelable operating leases for office
space and leasehold land:  

The
lease payments for land were subject to renegotiation as of January 1,
2006.  Per the lease agreement, the lease
payments will remain unchanged pending an appraisal, whereupon the lease rent
will be adjusted to fair market value.  Barnwell
does not know the amount of the new lease payments which could be effective upon
performance of the appraisal; they may remain unchanged or increase, and
Barnwell currently expects the adjustment, if any, to not be material.  The future rental payment disclosures above
assume the minimum lease payments for land in effect at December 31, 2005
remain unchanged through December 2025, the end of the lease term.  

   Overview   

  Barnwell
is engaged in the following lines of business: 1) oil and natural gas
exploration, development, production and sales essentially all in Canada (oil
and natural gas segment), 2) investment in leasehold land in Hawaii (land
investment segment), and 3) drilling wells and installing and repairing water
pumping systems in Hawaii (contract drilling segment).  

   Oil and Natural Gas
Segment   

  Barnwell
sells substantially all of its oil and condensate production under short-term
contracts with marketers of oil.  Natural
gas sold by Barnwell is generally sold under both long-term and short-term
contracts with prices indexed to market prices. 
The price of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids is freely
negotiated between the buyers and sellers.  Market prices for petroleum products are
dependent upon factors such as, but not limited to, changes in weather, storage
levels, and output.  Petroleum and
natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate
significantly.  For example, natural gas
prices for Barnwell, based on quarterly averages during the three years ended
September 30, 2006, have ranged from a low of $4.08 per thousand cubic
feet to a high of $9.76 per thousand cubic feet, and tend to be higher in the
winter than in the summer due to increased demand.  Oil and natural gas exploration, development
and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices, thus  

40     

in times of higher
product prices the cost of exploration, development and operation of oil and
natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well.  Barnwell s oil and natural gas operations
make capital expenditures in the exploration, development, and production of
oil and natural gas.  Cash outlays for
capital expenditures are largely discretionary, however, a minimum level of
capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves.  Due to the nature of oil and natural gas
exploration and development, significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate
success of any drilling effort.  

   Land Investment Segment   

  Barnwell
owns a 77.6% controlling interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general
partnership which owns interests in leasehold land and development rights for
property located approximately six miles north of the Kona International
Airport in the North Kona District of the Island of Hawaii, within and adjacent
to the Hualalai Resort at Historic Ka upulehu, between the Queen Kaahumanu
Highway and the Pacific Ocean.  Kaupulehu
Developments  development rights are under option to a developer and revenues
are recognized when options are exercised.  

  In
February 2004, Kaupulehu Developments entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement
with an independent buyer whereby Kaupulehu Developments transferred its
leasehold interest in approximately 870 acres zoned for resort/residential
development, in two increments, to the buyer. 
For the first increment ( Increment I ), Kaupulehu Developments received
an $11,550,000 cash closing payment in February 2004 and is also entitled to
receive future payments from the buyer based on the following percentages of
gross receipts from the developer s sales of single-family residential lots in Increment
I: 9% of the gross proceeds from single-family lot sales up to aggregate gross
proceeds of $100,000,000; 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than
$100,000,000 but less than $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross
proceeds in excess of $300,000,000.  

  In
June 2006, Kaupulehu Developments entered into an agreement whereby Kaupulehu
Developments sold its interest in the second increment ( Increment II ),
representing the remainder of the aforementioned approximately 870 acres.  Pursuant to this Agreement, Kaupulehu
Developments received $10,000,000 and is entitled to receive future payments
from the buyer based on a percentage of the sales prices of the residential
lots, ranging from 3.25% to 14%, to be determined in the future depending upon
a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior to
improvement.  This Agreement also
provides the buyer with the exclusive right to negotiate with Kaupulehu
Developments with respect to Lot 4C, which is comprised of approximately 1,000
acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation located adjacent to
Increment II.  This right expires in
June 2009 or, if the buyer completes any and all environmental assessments and
surveys reasonably required to support a petition to the Hawaii State Land Use
Commission for reclassification of Lot 4C zoning, in June 2012.  

  The
area in which Kaupulehu Developments  interests are located has experienced
demand for premium residential real estate in recent years, however there is no
assurance that any future development rights or percentage of sales payments
will be received.  

   Contract Drilling
Segment   

  Barnwell
also drills water, water monitoring and geothermal wells and installs and
repairs water pumping systems in Hawaii. 
Contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity, dollar
value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and
can fluctuate  

41     

significantly.  Water well drilling and pump installation activity
decreased during fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior year, and management
expects these activities to decrease similarly in fiscal 2007, as compared to
fiscal 2006.  

   Results
of Operation   

   Summary   

  Barnwell
generated net earnings of $14,637,000 in fiscal 2006, an $8,610,000 increase
from net earnings of $6,027,000 in fiscal 2005. 
The increase was due in part to the receipt of a payment from the sale
of Increment II of Kaupulehu Developments  leasehold land interests which
generated an operating profit, after minority interest and before taxes, of
approximately $4,621,000, higher prices received by Barnwell for all petroleum
products, the receipt of Percentage Payments from the sale of lots in Increment
I of the leasehold land interest previously held by Kaupulehu Developments, and
proceeds from real estate consulting services rendered.  The increase was also due in part to the
recognition of $4,130,000 of deferred tax benefits due to a reduction in the
valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards and $1,094,000 of
deferred tax benefits due to a reduction in Canadian income tax rates.  There were no Increment II receipts,
Percentage Payments, or real estate consulting proceeds received in fiscal 2005,
nor were there reductions in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit
carryforwards or Canadian tax rates in fiscal 2005.  

  The
fiscal year average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar
increased 7% in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, and the exchange rate
of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar increased 4% at September 30,
2006, as compared to September 30, 2005. 
This increase in the value of the Canadian dollar in U.S. dollars
increased Barnwell s reported revenues and expenses and assets and liabilities.  

  Barnwell
generated net earnings of $6,027,000 in fiscal 2005, a $2,683,000 decrease from
net earnings of $8,710,000 in fiscal 2004. 
The decrease was the result of fiscal 2004 net earnings including the
receipt of a closing payment from the sale of an interest in leasehold land in
February 2004 which generated an operating profit, after minority interest and
before taxes, of approximately $5,200,000, and deferred income tax benefits of
$1,740,000 resulting from the enactment of reductions in Canadian federal and
Alberta income tax rates; there were no such items in fiscal 2005.  Additionally, earnings decreased due to an
increase in stock appreciation rights expense, after income taxes, of
$1,608,000 in fiscal 2005 resulting from an increase in the market price of
Barnwell s stock and the issuance of additional stock options that have stock
appreciation rights.  These decreases in
net earnings were partially offset by increases in operating profits generated
by Barnwell s oil and natural gas and contract drilling segments.

  Oil
and natural gas revenues increased $5,180,000 (16%) from $32,724,000 in fiscal
2005 to $37,904,000 in fiscal 2006, due to increases in prices for all
petroleum products.  Natural gas
production increased 99,000 MCF at Dunvegan, Barnwell s principal oil and gas
property, and where Barnwell has invested approximately $9,750,000 in fiscal
2004 through fiscal 2006.  Natural gas
production also increased at Barnwell s newer properties at Doris, Boundary
Lake, Wood River and Bonanza/Balsam, but was more than offset by declines at
Progress, Leduc, Malmo and Pouce Coupe South, which are also newer properties.  

  Oil
production increased 6,000 barrels (4%) due to increased production from the
Progress and Wood River areas.  The
increase was partially offset by declines in oil production from the Bonanza/Balsam
area and the Red Earth area, which is Barnwell s largest oil producing property
and an older property.  

43     

The
Alberta Royalty Tax Credit ( ARTC ) program has been discontinued by the Alberta
government, effective January 1, 2007. 
In fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, Barnwell received $438,000,
$409,000 and $377,000, respectively, under the ARTC program.  The ARTC payments were recorded as a credit
against oil and natural gas royalties and reported in oil and natural gas
revenues.  In fiscal 2007, Barnwell
expects to receive approximately $100,000 under the ARTC program, representing
the ARTC for the period from October 1, 2006 to December 31,
2006.  Beginning January 1, 2007,
Barnwell will no longer receive ARTC payments.  

  Oil
and natural gas revenues increased $8,884,000 (37%) from $23,840,000 in fiscal
2004 to $32,724,000 in fiscal 2005, due to increases in prices for all
petroleum products and increases in natural gas production, partially offset by
a decrease in net oil production. 
Natural gas production increased principally due to an increase in
production at Dunvegan.  Net natural gas
production at Dunvegan increased 227,000 MCF or 15% and net natural gas liquids
and oil production at Dunvegan increased 10,000 barrels or 12%.  Natural gas production also increased at
Barnwell s newer properties at Doris, Malmo and Armada, but declined at Bonanza/Balsam,
Leduc and Progress, which are also newer properties, and at other older
properties which largely offset the net increase in production at the newer
properties.  Additionally, natural gas
and natural gas liquids production at Dunvegan was reduced by approximately
30,000 MCF and 3,000 barrels, respectively, in fiscal 2005 as compared to
fiscal 2004 due to plant maintenance in fiscal 2005.  There was no such plant maintenance program
in fiscal 2004.  

  Oil
production declined in fiscal 2005 due to a 12,000 barrel (15%) decline in
production at Barnwell s largest oil producing property, Red Earth, principally
due to the natural aging of the property. 
Oil production also declined at other mature properties but these
declines were offset by increases in production at Bonanza/Balsam, one of
Barnwell s newer properties.  

   Oil and natural
gas operating expenses   

  Operating expenses increased $1,318,000 (19%) to
$8,217,000 in fiscal 2006, as compared to $6,899,000 in fiscal 2005.  The increase was due to higher fuel,
utilities and oilfield services costs at all properties, and higher repairs and
maintenance costs at older properties and to a 7% increase in the average
exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar that increased oil and
natural gas operating expenses $535,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior
year.  

  Operating expenses increased $926,000 (16%) to
$6,899,000 in fiscal 2005, as compared to $5,973,000 in fiscal 2004.  The increase was primarily due to an 8%
increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar
that increased oil and natural gas operating expenses $546,000 in fiscal 2005
as compared to the prior year.  Also
contributing to the increase were operating expenses on new wells.  

   Sale of interest in
leasehold land, Sale of development rights and Minority interest in earnings   

  In
February 2004, Kaupulehu Developments, a land development general partnership
in which Barnwell owns a 77.6% controlling interest, entered into a Purchase
and Sale Agreement with WB KD Acquisition, LLC ( WB ) by which Kaupulehu
Developments transferred its leasehold interest in approximately 870 acres
zoned for resort/residential development, in two increments, to WB.  There is  

44     

no
affiliation between Kaupulehu Developments and WB.  WB is affiliated with Westbrook Partners, the
developers of the Kuki o Resort located adjacent to the Hualalai Resort at
Historic Ka upulehu.  The first increment
( Increment I ) is an area planned for approximately 80 single-family lots
and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the Pacific
Ocean.  The purchasers of the 80
single-family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the Kuki o
Resort Golf and Beach Club, which is located adjacent to and south of the Four
Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka upulehu. 
The second increment ( Increment II ) is the remaining portion of
the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for single-family and
multi-family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse.  

  With
respect to Increment I, Kaupulehu Developments received an $11,550,000
payment in February 2004 and is entitled to receive payment of the following
percentages of the gross proceeds generated from the sale by WB of
single-family lots in Increment I ( Percentage Payments ): 9% of the gross
proceeds from single-family lot sales up to aggregate gross proceeds of
$100,000,000; 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than $100,000,000
but less than $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross proceeds in excess
of $300,000,000.  Minimum amounts of these
Percentage Payments are due by certain dates. 
WB sold a total of five single-family lots and paid Kaupulehu
Developments $3,660,000 in Percentage Payments during the year ended
September 30, 2006.  Revenue from
the Percentage Payments was reduced by $220,000 of fees related to the sales,
resulting in net revenues of $3,440,000 and a $2,688,000 operating profit,
after minority interest.  There were no
lot sales, and therefore, no Percentage Payments received during fiscal
2005.  There is no assurance that any
future payments will be received.  

  WB
also agreed to pay Kaupulehu Developments subsequent to February 2004 interim
payments of $50,000 per month ( Interim Payments ) up to a total of
$900,000.  Kaupulehu Developments
received the $900,000 in full as of August 2005.  

  In
June 2006, Kaupulehu Developments entered into an Agreement ( Increment II
Agreement ) with WB and WB KD Acquisition II, LLC ( WBKD ) by which Kaupulehu
Developments sold its interest in Increment II, representing the remainder
of the approximately 870 acres, to WBKD. 
There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu Developments and WB or
WBKD.  WB and WBKD are both affiliates of
Westbrook Partners, developers of the nearby Kuki o Resort.  Pursuant to the Increment II Agreement,
Kaupulehu Developments received a $10,000,000 payment and is entitled to
receive future payments from WBKD based on a percentage of the sales prices of
the residential lots, ranging from 3.25% to 14%, to be determined in the future
depending upon a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior
to improvement.  The revenue from the
$10,000,000 payment received in fiscal 2006 was reduced by $600,000 of fees
related to the sale, $220,000 in other costs related to the sale, and
approximately $2,983,000 of previously capitalized costs relating to Increment II,
resulting in net revenues of $6,197,000 and a $4,621,000 operating profit,
after minority interest.  There were no
Increment II Percentage Payments received during the year ended
September 30, 2006.  There is no
assurance that any future payments will be received.  

  In
addition, under the terms of the Increment II Agreement, WBKD has the exclusive
right to negotiate with Kaupulehu Developments with respect to Lot 4C, which is
comprised of approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation
located adjacent to Increment II. 
This right expires in June 2009 or, if WBKD completes any and all
environmental assessments and surveys reasonably required to support a petition
to the Hawaii State Land Use Commission for reclassification of Lot 4C zoning,
in June 2012.  

45     

The
sales of Kaupulehu Developments  Increment I and Increment II
leasehold land interests in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2006, respectively, were
accounted for pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66 which provides
specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sale revenue can be
recorded.  The revenue recognized in
fiscal 2004 from the $11,550,000 payment plus $350,000 of post-closing Interim
Payments, was reduced by $693,000 of fees related to the sale, approximately
$402,000 in other costs related to the sale, and $3,475,000 of previously
capitalized costs relating to Increment I resulting in net revenues of
$7,330,000 and an operating profit, after minority interest, of approximately
$5,470,000.  During fiscal 2005,
Kaupulehu Developments received additional Interim Payments, before minority
interest, totaling $550,000.  The revenue
recognized in fiscal 2006 from the $10,000,000 Increment II payment and
the $3,660,000 of Percentage Payments received on the Increment I lot
sales was reduced by $820,000 of fees related to the sale, $220,000 in other
costs related to the sales, and approximately $2,983,000 of previously
capitalized costs relating to Increment II resulting in net revenues of
$9,637,000 and an operating profit, after minority interest, of approximately $7,309,000.  The Increment I, Increment II and
Interim Payment revenues, net of related fees and other costs, are recorded in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Sale of interest in leasehold
land, net.   

  The
development rights held by Kaupulehu Developments are for residentially-zoned
leasehold land within and adjacent to the Hualalai Golf Club and the second
golf course and are under option to Kaupulehu Makai Venture, an unrelated
entity.  Sales of Kaupulehu Developments 
development rights are accounted for pursuant to the provisions of SFAS
No. 66 which provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine
when land sale revenue can be recorded. 
Net revenues from the sale of development rights were $2,702,000 in
fiscal 2006 and $2,497,000 in fiscal years 2005 and 2004.  In November 2005, Kaupulehu Makai Venture, an
unrelated entity, paid Kaupulehu Developments a non-refundable payment of
$2,875,000 upon exercising the portion of its development rights option due on
December 31, 2005 of $2,656,250 and a $218,750 portion of its development
rights option due on December 31, 2006. 
Revenue from the development rights sale was reduced by $173,000 of fees
related to the sale, resulting in net revenues of $2,702,000 and a $2,111,000
operating profit, after minority interest, on the transaction.  In December 2004 and 2003, Kaupulehu Makai
Venture exercised the portion of its development rights option that was to
expire and paid Kaupulehu Developments $2,656,000.  Revenues from these development rights sales
were reduced by $159,000 of fees related to the sale, resulting in net revenues
of $2,497,000 and a $1,950,000 operating profit, after minority interest, on
the transaction during each of fiscal years 2005 and 2004.  There were no other costs deducted from
revenues from the sale of development rights in the years ended September 30,
2006, 2005 and 2004 as all capitalized costs associated with the development
rights were expensed in previous years. 
The development rights option revenues, net of related fees, are
recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Sale of development
rights, net.   

  The
total amount of remaining future development rights option receipts at
September 30, 2006, if all options are fully exercised, is $13,062,500,
comprised of the balance of $2,437,500 due on December 31, 2006 and four
payments of $2,656,250 due on each December 31 of years 2007 to 2010.  If any annual option payment is not made, the
then remaining development right options will expire.  There is no assurance that any portion of the
remaining options will be exercised.  

  The aforementioned $173,000 in fees ($121,000
net of minority interest) on the $2,875,000 development rights proceeds and the
$820,000 in fees ($575,000 net of minority interest) on the  

46     

Percentage Payments and Increment II payment
proceeds received in fiscal 2006, as well as the $159,000 in fees ($112,000,
net of minority interest) on the proceeds from the sale of development rights
in fiscal 2005 and 2004, and the $693,000 in fees ($486,000, net of minority
interest) on the proceeds from the closing and Interim Payments received for
the sale of interest in leasehold land in the year ended September 30,
2004 were paid to Nearco, Inc. ( Nearco ), a company controlled by Mr. Terry
Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an indirect 20.6% owner of Kaupulehu
Developments.  Under an agreement entered
into in 1987, prior to Mr. Johnston s election to Barnwell s Board of
Directors, Barnwell is obligated to pay Nearco 2% of Kaupulehu Developments 
gross receipts from real estate transactions, and Cambridge Hawaii Limited
Partnership, a 49.9% partner of Kaupulehu Developments in which Barnwell
purchased a 55.2% interest in April 2001, is obligated under an agreement
entered into in 1987 to pay Nearco 4% of Kaupulehu Developments  gross receipts
from real estate transactions.  The fees
represent compensation for promotion and marketing of Kaupulehu Developments 
property and were determined based on the estimated fair value of such
services.  Barnwell believes the fees are
fair and reasonable compensation for such services.  

  Fees were also paid to Nearco for consulting
services related to Kaupulehu Developments  leasehold land.  In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, consulting
service fees paid to Nearco totaled $76,000, $268,000 and $273,000,
respectively, and were included in general and administrative expenses.  In addition, $52,000 of fees was paid to
Nearco in fiscal 2004 for services related to the closing of the February 2004
sale of an interest in leasehold land. 
These fees were a direct cost of the sale and accordingly reduced the
revenues recognized from the sale. 
Barnwell believes the fees are fair and reasonable compensation for such
services.  

   Contract drilling   

  Contract
drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump
installation, replacement and repair in Hawaii.  

  Contract
drilling revenues decreased $1,778,000 (23%) to $5,866,000 in fiscal 2006, as
compared to $7,644,000 in fiscal 2005, and contract drilling operating expenses
decreased $1,056,000 (18%) to $4,709,000 in fiscal 2006, as compared to $5,765,000
in fiscal 2005.  Operating profit before general
and administrative expenses decreased $786,000 (45%) from $1,754,000 in fiscal
2005 to $968,000 in fiscal 2006 due to a de  crease
in well drilling work coupled with a decrease in the values and margins of
contracts performed in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005.    Contract drilling revenues and costs are
not seasonal in nature but can fluctuate significantly based on the awarding
and timing of contracts, which are determined by contract drilling customer
demand.    Management
currently estimates that operating profit will be lower in fiscal 2007 due to
lower estimated margins on contracts in backlog.  

  At
September 30, 2006, there was a backlog of four well drilling contracts
and nine pump installation and repair contracts, of which four, two well
drilling and two pump installation and repair, were in progress as of September 30,
2006.  The backlog of contract drilling
revenues as of November 30, 2006 was approximately $4,900,000.  

  Contract
drilling revenues increased $3,954,000 (107%) to $7,644,000 in fiscal 2005, as
compared to $3,690,000 in fiscal 2004, and contract drilling operating expenses
increased $2,581,000 (81%) to $5,765,000 in fiscal 2005, as compared to
$3,184,000 in fiscal 2004.  Operating
profit before  

47     

general
and administrative expenses increased $1,346,000 (330%) from $408,000 in fiscal
2004 to $1,754,000 in fiscal 2005 due to an increase in water well drilling
activity and higher margins on contracts performed throughout most of fiscal
2005, as compared to fiscal 2004.  

   Gain on sale of
drill rig   

  Barnwell sold a drill rig
in fiscal 2006 for $712,000, net of costs associated with the sale, and
recognized a gain of $700,000; there was no such sale in fiscal 2005.  The drill rig was identical to one of
Barnwell s other drill rigs and was originally purchased to drill geothermal
wells.  The sale brings Barnwell s drilling
rig count to four rigs.  

   Gas processing and
other income   

  Gas processing and other income increased $356,000 (45%)
to $1,151,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to $795,000 in fiscal 2005.  The increase was primarily due to a $243,000
increase in interest income received from certificates of deposit and cash
management funds, gains on sales of other assets of $73,000, and a $42,000
increase in gas processing revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal
2005.  

  Gas processing and other income decreased $388,000
(33%) to $795,000 in fiscal 2005 as compared to $1,183,000 in fiscal 2004.  In fiscal 2004, Kaupulehu Developments
received $250,000 in income related to negotiations on the development of
Kaupulehu Developments  resort/residential acreage; such negotiation revenues
discontinued with the consummation of Kaupulehu Developments  sale of an
interest in leasehold land in February 2004, therefore there were no such
revenues in fiscal 2005.  In addition,
fiscal 2004 gas processing and other income included a $139,000 gain from the
sale of a parcel of vacant land formerly used as a storage and maintenance yard
by Barnwell s contract drilling segment; there was no such sale in fiscal 2005.  

   General and administrative
expenses   

  General
and administrative expenses decreased $87,000 (1%) to $11,644,000 in fiscal 2006,
as compared to $11,731,000 in fiscal 2005. 
The decrease was primarily due to a $3,061,000 decrease in stock
appreciation rights expense for the year ended September 30, 2006 due to
fluctuations in Barnwell s stock price, partially offset by an increase in the
number of shares vested.  This decrease was
partially offset by increased personnel costs of $1,323,000; increased
professional services incurred in connection with the preparation for future
requirements to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, legal fees related to the
land segment, audit fees and actuarial fees for a total of $1,000,000;
decreased administrative expense reimbursements from oil and natural gas joint
venture partners of $523,000; and an increase in share-based compensation of
$144,000 due to implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) during the year ended
September 30, 2006.  

  General
and administrative expenses increased $3,820,000 (48%) to $11,731,000 in fiscal
2005, as compared to $7,911,000 in fiscal 2004. 
The increase was due in part to a $2,509,000 increase in stock
appreciation rights expense resulting from an increase in Barnwell s stock
price and the issuance of additional stock options with stock appreciation
rights in fiscal 2005, as compared to the prior year.  Personnel costs also increased by $1,192,000
in fiscal 2005 as a result of the addition of new personnel in the oil and
natural gas operations and increased compensation costs.  In addition, professional fees  

48     

increased
$215,000 in fiscal 2005 due to higher legal and audit fees, as a result of
increased costs of regulatory compliance, and consulting services related to
Barnwell s oil and natural gas leases.  

  General
and administrative expenses also includes fees paid to Nearco, an entity
controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an indirect 20.6%
owner of Kaupulehu Developments, for consulting services related to Kaupulehu
Developments  leasehold land.  Fees paid
to Nearco totaled $76,000, $268,000 and $273,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  Barnwell believes the fees
are fair and reasonable compensation for such services.  

   Depletion, depreciation
and amortization   

  Depletion, depreciation
and amortization increased $2,789,000 (32%) to $11,577,000 in fiscal 2006, as
compared to $8,788,000 in fiscal 2005  , due to a 22% increase in
the depletion rate, a 1% increase in production (in MCF equivalents where one
barrel of oil and natural gas liquids are converted to 5.8 MCF equivalents) and
a 7% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S.
dollar.  

  The higher depletion rate
is due to increases in Barnwell s costs of finding and developing proven
reserves, and costs that are incurred to decrease the rate of production
declines or maintain or increase rates of production from reserves found in
previous years.  Barnwell s cost of
finding and developing proven reserves has increased due to the cost of oil and
natural gas exploration and development having increased along with product
prices and the drilling of unsuccessful wells.  

  Depletion, depreciation
and amortization increased $2,027,000 (30%) to $8,788,000 in fiscal 2005, as
compared to $6,761,000 in fiscal 2004  , due to a 17% increase in
the depletion rate, a 4% increase in production (in MCF equivalents where one
barrel of oil and natural gas liquids are converted to 5.8 MCF equivalents) and
an 8% increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S.
dollar.  

   Interest expense   

  Interest expense
increased $217,000 (35%) to $833,000 in fiscal 2006, as compared to $616,000 in
fiscal 2005, due to higher average interest rates and, to a lesser degree,
higher average loan balances during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005.  The average interest rate incurred during
fiscal 2006 on Barnwell s borrowings from Royal Bank of Canada increased to
6.67%, as compared to 4.82% in fiscal 2005. 
The weighted-average balance of outstanding borrowings from Royal Bank
of Canada increased to $11,640,000 in fiscal 2006 as compared to $10,300,000 in
fiscal 2005.  

  Interest expense
increased $129,000 (26%) to $616,000 in fiscal 2005, as compared to $487,000 in
fiscal 2004, due to higher average interest rates during fiscal 2005 as
compared to fiscal 2004.  The average
interest rate incurred during fiscal 2005 on Barnwell s borrowings from Royal
Bank of Canada increased to 4.82%, as compared to 3.67% in fiscal 2004.  The weighted-average balance of outstanding
borrowings from Royal Bank of Canada remained relatively unchanged at
approximately $10,300,000 in fiscal 2005 and 2004.  

49     

The majority of Barnwell s
debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. 
Therefore, the increase in the average exchange rate of the Canadian
dollar to the U.S. dollar had a minimal impact on interest expense.  

   Foreign currency fluctuations   

  In addition to U.S.
operations, Barnwell conducts operations in Canada.  Consequently, Barnwell is subject to foreign
currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of
the exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar.  

  The
fiscal year average exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar
increased 7% in fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, and the exchange rate
of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar increased 4% at September 30,
2006, as compared to September 30, 2005. 
Accordingly, the revenues and expenses and assets, liabilities and
stockholders  equity of Barnwell s subsidiaries operating in Canada have
increased.  Barnwell s Canadian dollar
assets are greater than its Canadian dollar liabilities; therefore, increases
in value of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar generate other comprehensive
income.  The fiscal year average exchange
rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar increased 8% in fiscal 2005, as
compared to fiscal 2004, and the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the
U.S. dollar increased 9% at September 30, 2005, as compared to September 30,
2004.  Other comprehensive income due to
foreign currency translation adjustments for fiscal 2006 was $1,140,000, a $403,000
decrease from other comprehensive income of $1,543,000 in fiscal 2005.  

  Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses were not material in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004
and are reflected in general and administrative expenses.  

  The impact of
fluctuations of the exchange rates between the Canadian dollar and the U.S.
dollar may be material from period to period. 
Barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between the
Canadian and U.S. dollars.  

   Income taxes   

  In
May 2006, a bill reducing the Province of Alberta s corporate tax rate from
11.5% to 10.0% effective April 1, 2006 received Royal Assent and was
passed into law.  In June 2006, Royal
Assent was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada which reduces
the federal corporate income tax rate to 19% from 21% by 2010 starting
January 1, 2008.  The federal
corporate surtax will also be eliminated effective January 1, 2008.  Accordingly, during the year ended
September 30, 2006, Barnwell s Canadian net deferred income tax
liabilities were reduced by approximately $1,094,000 as a result of these
reductions in Canadian tax rates.  There
was no benefit attributable to changes in Canada s federal or Alberta s
provincial corporate tax rates in the year ended September 30, 2005.  

  Also
included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended
September 30, 2006 is the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit of
$4,130,000 due to a reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit
carryforwards.  The acceleration of
Barnwell s investments in Canadian oil and natural gas properties beginning in
the first quarter of fiscal 2006 resulted in the determination that it was more
likely than not that fiscal 2006 and future years  taxable income from Canadian
operations under U.S. tax law will exceed taxable income from Canadian
operations under Canadian tax law to a degree that will result in the
utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards to  

50     

reduce
U.S. taxes.  This is primarily
attributable to differences in the statutory deduction rates for Barnwell s
Canadian oil and natural gas capital expenditures under Canadian tax law as
compared to such deductions under U.S. tax law. 
There was no reduction in the valuation allowance for foreign tax credit
carryforwards in the year ended September 30, 2005.  Barnwell s estimates of the tax effects of
temporary differences under both Canadian tax jurisdiction and U.S. tax
jurisdiction that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities and
estimates of deferred tax asset valuation allowances require subjective
assumptions including, among others, estimates of Canadian taxable income, U.S.
taxable income and Canadian capital expenditures in future years.  

  In November 2003, Royal
Assent was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada, which was
then enacted into law, to reduce Canada s corporate tax rate on  resource 
income (income derived from oil and natural gas operations) over a four-year
period beginning January 1, 2003 from 29% to 21% beginning January 1,
2007.  Additionally, the bill phases in
over the same four-year period tax deductions for royalties, which previously
were not tax deductible, and phases out the Resource Allowance deduction along
with other changes.  Accordingly, during
fiscal 2004, Barnwell s Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were
reduced by approximately $1,440,000 due to the reduction in Canada s federal
corporate tax rate.  There was no benefit
attributable to changes in Canada s corporate tax rate on  resource  income in
fiscal 2005.  Barnwell s Canadian net
deferred income tax liabilities were also reduced by approximately $300,000 in
fiscal 2004 as a result of the Province of Alberta s reduction of the province s
corporate tax rate from 13.0% to 12.5%, effective April 1, 2003 (enacted into
law in December 2003), and from 12.5% to 11.5%, effective April 1, 2004
(enacted into law in May 2004).  

   Equity in earnings of real estate
affiliate   

  In
June 2006, Barnwell entered into an agreement with Nearco to form Mauka 3K
for the purpose of providing real estate consulting services and investing in
real estate. Barnwell and Nearco each have an equal 50% voting interest in
Mauka 3K.  Nearco is a company
controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an indirect 20.6%
owner of Kaupulehu Developments, a general partnership in which Barnwell owns a
77.6% controlling interest.  Barnwell
does not have a controlling interest in Mauka 3K and thus accounts for its
investment utilizing the equity method of accounting.  Under the equity method of accounting, Barnwell s
proportionate share of its affiliate s income is included in equity in earnings
of real estate affiliate.  

  In
September 2006 Barnwell received net proceeds of $1,440,000 representing its
share of real estate consulting revenues, less related expenses.  The net proceeds are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Equity in earnings of real estate
affiliate, net of tax.   

   Environmental
Matters   

  Federal,
state, and Canadian governmental agencies issue rules and regulations and
enforce laws to protect the environment which are often difficult and costly to
comply with and which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply,
particularly in regard to the discharge of materials into the environment.  The regulatory burden on the oil and gas
industry increases its cost of doing business. 
These laws, rules and regulations affect the operations of Barnwell and
could have a material adverse effect upon the earnings or competitive position
of Barnwell.  Although Barnwell s
experience has been to the contrary, there is no assurance that this will
continue to be the case.  

51     

Inflation   

  The
effect of inflation on Barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of
operations, interest cost (as a substantial portion of Barnwell s debt is at
variable short-term rates of interest which tend to increase as inflation
increases), general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with
oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations.  Oil and natural gas prices realized by
Barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western
Canadian/Midwestern U.S. prices for natural gas.  

   Recent Accounting
Pronouncements   

  In May 2005, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 154,  Accounting Changes and Error
Correction   a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
No. 3.   This statement changes the
requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting
principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle.  It also applies to changes required by an
accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does
not include specific transition provisions. 
When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those
provisions should be followed. 
Accounting Principal Board ( APB ) No. 20 required that most
voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net
income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new
accounting principle.  This statement
requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of
changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either
the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change.  The
provisions of SFAS No. 154 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2005.  

  In
February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,  Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments,  which amends SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  and SFAS No. 140,  Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities.   SFAS No. 155 is aimed
at improving the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by
requiring more consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a
means to simplify the accounting for these instruments.  SFAS No. 155 is applicable to new or
modified financial instruments in fiscal years beginning after September 15,
2006, though the provisions related to fair value accounting for hybrid
financial instruments can also be applied to existing instruments.  Early adoption, as of the beginning of an
entity s fiscal year, is also permitted, provided interim financial statements
have not yet been issued.  Adoption of
the provisions of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material impact
on Barnwell s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  

  In
March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,  Accounting for Servicing of
Financial Assets,  which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain
hedge-like (offset) accounting.  SFAS
No. 156 amends FASB Statement No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,  with respect
to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing
liabilities.  SFAS No. 156
i) requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing
liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by
entering into a servicing contract in certain situations; ii) requires
that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be
initially measured at fair value, if practicable; iii) permits an entity
to choose  

52     

either the amortization
method or the fair value method for subsequent measurement for each class of
separately recognized servicing assets or servicing liabilities;
iv) permits at initial adoption a one-time reclassification of
available-for-sale securities to trading securities by an entity with
recognized servicing rights, provided the securities reclassified offset the
entity s exposure to changes in the fair value of the servicing assets or
liabilities; and v) requires separate presentation of servicing assets and
servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet
and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and
servicing liabilities.  SFAS No. 156
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as
of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after
September 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted in certain
circumstances.  SFAS No. 156 also
describes the manner in which it should be initially applied.  Adoption of the provisions of SFAS
No. 156 is not expected to have a material impact on Barnwell s financial
condition, results of operations, or liquidity.  

  In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation ( FIN )
No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes   an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109.   This
interpretation prescribes a  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold and
measurement attribute (the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50%
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities) for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides
guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in
interim periods, disclosure and transition. 
FIN No. 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006.  Barnwell s
management is currently evaluating the effect of these provisions on Barnwell s
results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

  In June 2006, the FASB
ratified the consensus on Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) Issue
No. 06-3,  How Taxes Collected
from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in
the Income Statement.   The scope
of EITF 06-3 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is
directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a
customer and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added,
Universal Service Fund contributions and some excise taxes.  The Task Force affirmed its conclusion that
entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a gross
or a net basis, based on their accounting policy, which should be disclosed
pursuant to APB Opinion No. 22,  Disclosure
of Accounting Policies.   If such
taxes are significant and are presented on a gross basis, the amounts of those
taxes should be disclosed.  The consensus
on EITF 06-3 will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2006. 
Barnwell s management is currently evaluating the effect of these
provisions on Barnwell s results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity.  

  In September 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value
Measurements.   SFAS No. 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements.  SFAS No. 157 does not
require any new fair value measurements, however, for some entities, the
application of SFAS No. 157 will change current practice.  SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007.  Barnwell s management is currently evaluating
the effect of these provisions on Barnwell s results of operations, financial
condition and liquidity.  

  In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
and 132(R).   SFAS No. 158 requires
an employer to recognize the over-funded or under-funded status  

53     

of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer
plan) as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to
recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur
through comprehensive income.  SFAS No. 158
also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as
of the date of the employer s fiscal year-end statement of financial position
(with limited exceptions).  Under SFAS
No. 158, Barnwell will be required to recognize the funded status of its
defined benefit postretirement plan and supplemental employee retirement plan
and to provide the required disclosures. 
SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2006.  If SFAS
No. 158 were applied as of September 30, 2006, Barnwell would have
recognized an additional pension and other postretirement benefit obligation of
approximately $1,500,000 along with a corresponding decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive income of approximately $990,000, net of $510,000 of
deferred income tax benefits associated with the temporary difference between
pension and postretirement liabilities recognized for book versus tax purposes.  

  In September 2006, the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 108,  Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements.   SAB
No. 108 provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior
year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of
a materiality assessment.  SAB No. 108
establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement
errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheet and
statement of operations financial statements and the related financial
statement disclosures.  SAB No. 108 permits
existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying
this approach in the first year ending after November 15, 2006 by
recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets
and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment
recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.  Additionally, the use of the cumulative effect
transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each
individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and
when it arose.  Barnwell s management is
currently evaluating the effect of these provisions on Barnwell s results of
operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   

   Cash Flows, Debt
and Available Credit   

  Cash
flows provided by operations totaled $18,129,000 for fiscal 2006, an increase
of $3,916,000 as compared to $14,213,000 of cash flows provided by operations
for the same period in the prior year.  The
increase was due to higher operating cash flow generated by Barnwell s oil and
natural gas segment and to fluctuations in current assets and liabilities.  

  Cash flows used in
investing activities totaled $7,304,000 for fiscal 2006, a decrease of $6,119,000
from cash flows used in investing activities of $13,423,000 in fiscal 2005.  Cash inflows from investing activities
increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, due primarily to
Kaupulehu Developments  receipt of a closing payment from the sale of its
interest in Increment II which generated   $9,180,000   of proceeds, net of expenses, in fiscal
2006; there were no sales related to Increment II in the prior year.  The increase was also due to $3,440,000 of Percentage
Payments, net of expenses, received from WB for WB s Lot 4A Increment I
sales; there were no such proceeds received  

54     

in fiscal 2005.  Barnwell also received $2,702,000 of
proceeds, net of expenses, from the sale of development rights during fiscal
2006, as compared to $2,497,000 of proceeds, net of expenses, received during
fiscal 2005.  Investing cash flows for
the current year also include $1,700,000 of proceeds from the maturity of
certificates of deposit, as compared to net investments in certificates of
deposit of $313,000 in the prior year, and $712,000 of proceeds, net of
associated costs, from the sale of a drill rig; there were no such fixed asset
sales proceeds received in fiscal 2005. 
The increase in cash flows from investing activities was partially
offset by an $8,670,000 increase in capital expenditures, primarily
attributable to the oil and natural gas segment, to $25,385,000 in fiscal 2006,
as compared to $16,715,000 in fiscal 2005.  

  Cash
flows used in financing activities totaled $4,525,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2006, a $4,523,000 increase from $2,000 of cash used in
financing activities in fiscal 2005. 
This increase was primarily due to $3,095,000   of distributions made to minority interest partners
in the current year, as compared to $513,000 of distributions in the prior year,
and dividend payments totaling $1,430,000 in fiscal 2006, as compared to
$802,000 in the prior year.  Additionally,
Barnwell borrowed $1,116,000 in long-term debt and received $197,000 in
proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2005; there were no long-term
debt borrowings or proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2006.  

  In October 2005, Barnwell
declared a three-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend.  The new shares were distributed on
November 14, 2005 to all shareholders of record as of October 28,
2005.  

  In
December 2005, Barnwell declared a cash dividend of $0.025 per share payable
January 4, 2006 to stockholders of record on December 20, 2005.  

  In
February 2006, Barnwell declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable
March 15, 2006 to stockholders of record on March 1, 2006.  

  In
May 2006, Barnwell declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable
June 15, 2006 to stockholders of record on June 1, 2006.  

  In
August 2006, Barnwell declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share, payable
September 15, 2006, to stockholders of record on September 1, 2006.  

  Royal Bank of Canada has
renewed Barnwell s credit facility through April 2007 at $20,000,000 Canadian
dollars, approximately US$17,932,000, at September 30, 2006.  All other terms of the credit facility
remained unchanged upon renewal.  The
bank affirmed that it will not require any repayments under the facility before
October 1, 2007.  Accordingly,
Barnwell has classified outstanding borrowings under the facility as long-term
debt.  

  At September 30, 2006,
Barnwell had $11,972,000 in cash and cash equivalents, $3,226,000 in working
capital, and approximately $6,197,000 of available credit under its credit
facility with Royal Bank of Canada.  Barnwell believes its current cash balances,
future cash flows from operations, land segment proceeds from the sale of
development rights and percentage of sales payments, and available credit will
be sufficient to fund its estimated capital expenditures and operations for at
least the next 12 months and settle incentive compensation liabilities in cash
if necessary.  However, if oil and
natural gas  

55     

production declines from current levels or oil and natural gas prices
decline from current levels, current working capital balances and cash flows
generated by operations may not be sufficient to fund Barnwell s current
projected level of oil and natural gas capital expenditures, in which case
Barnwell may fund capital expenditures with funds generated by land segment
sales, long-term debt borrowings, or it may reduce future oil and natural gas
capital expenditures.    Additionally, if Barnwell s credit facility
with a Canadian bank is reduced below the current level of borrowings under the
facility after the April 2007 review, Barnwell may be required to reduce
expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing to make any required
payments under the facility.   

   Oil and Natural
Gas Capital Expenditures   

  Barnwell s oil and
natural gas capital expenditures, including accrued capital expenditures,
increased $7,720,000 (42%) from $18,229,000 in fiscal 2005 to $25,949,000 in fiscal
2006  .  Barnwell participated in
drilling 47 gross (13.5 net) wells, of which 40 gross (11.2 net) wells were
initially deemed by management to be successful, and replaced 73% of oil
production (including natural gas liquids) and 123% of natural gas production.  Of these 47 gross wells in fiscal 2006, Barnwell
initiated 28 gross (11.7 net) wells.  Of
the $25,949,000 total oil and natural gas properties investments for fiscal 2006,
$3,273,000 (13%) was for acquisition of leases and lease rentals, $1,870,000 (7%)
was for geological and geophysical costs, $15,878,000 (61%) was for intangible
drilling costs, $4,328,000 (17%) was for production equipment, and $600,000 (2%)
was for future site restoration and abandonment and other costs.  The major areas of investments in fiscal 2006
were in the Progress, Pouce Coupe South, Simonette, Dunvegan, Swalwell,
Josephine, Bonanza/Balsam, and Doris areas of Alberta.  

  The
following table sets forth the gross and net numbers of oil and natural gas
wells Barnwell participated in drilling for each of the last three fiscal
years:  

Barnwell
estimates that oil and natural gas capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 will
range from $13,500,000 to $16,000,000. 
This estimated amount may increase or decrease as dictated by management s
assessment of the oil and natural gas environment and prospects.  

   Subsequent Events   

  In
December 2006, Barnwell declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share payable
January 15, 2007, to stockholders of record on December 28, 2006.  

56     

In
November 2006, Kaupulehu Investors, LLC, a limited liability company
wholly-owned by Barnwell, invested $3,000,000 in two unrelated limited liability
companies to acquire a passive minority interest in Hualalai Resort, located at
Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii, which includes the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai
at Historic Ka upulehu, two golf courses and undeveloped residential
property.  Barnwell s internal cash flows
are expected to be sufficient to finance this investment.  

   ITEM 7A.                           QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    

  The
primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking
quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market
risks.  The term  market risk  refers to
the risk of loss arising from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices,
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  The disclosures are not meant to be precise
indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably
possible losses.  This forward-looking
information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market
risk exposures.  All of our market risk
sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative
trading.  

   Commodity Price Risk   

  Our most significant exposure in market risk is
in the pricing of our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ( NGL )
production.  Realized pricing is
primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot
market prices applicable to our Canadian natural gas and NGL production.  Pricing for oil, natural gas and NGL production
has historically been volatile and unpredictable.  

  Currently, Barnwell accepts
the volatility risk that oil and natural gas prices present as Barnwell has not
entered into transactions utilizing derivative financial instruments or
derivative commodity instruments.  In
addition, virtually none of Barnwell s estimated 2007 oil or natural gas
production is subject to fixed-price physical delivery contracts.  

   Interest Rate Risk    

  Barnwell is exposed to
changes in U.S. and Canadian interest rates, primarily resulting from its
borrowing and investing activities used to fund operations and maintain
liquidity.  Barnwell has a revolving
credit facility which carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market
indices.  The credit facility is
available in U.S. dollars at the London Interbank Offer Rate plus 2%, at U.S.
prime plus 1%, or in Canadian dollars at Canadian prime plus 1%.  

   Foreign Currency Exchange
Risk   

  Barnwell s
oil and natural gas operations are conducted in Canada and accordingly,
Barnwell is subject to foreign currency risk. 
Barnwell s net assets, net earnings and cash flows from our Canadian
subsidiaries are based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of such amounts measured
in the Canadian dollar functional currency. 
Assets and liabilities of the Canadian subsidiaries are translated to
U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting
period.  Revenues, expenses and cash flow
are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period.

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA     

   Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     

  The Board of Directors
and Shareholders 
  Barnwell Industries, Inc.:  

  We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Barnwell Industries,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders  equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
September 30, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

  In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Barnwell
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2006 and 2005, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended September 30, 2006, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements, effective October 1, 2005, the Company
changed its method of accounting for share-based payments.

BARNWELL INDUSTRIES, INC. 
AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, 2005 AND 2004    

   1.              DESCRIPTION OF THE REPORTING
ENTITY AND BUSINESS    

  The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Barnwell Industries,
Inc. and all majority-owned subsidiaries, including an indirect 77.6%-owned
land development general partnership, (collectively referred to herein as  Barnwell ).  All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.  Investments
in companies over which Barnwell has the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method.  

  During
its last three fiscal years, Barnwell was engaged in exploring for, developing,
producing and selling oil and natural gas in Canada, investing in leasehold
land in Hawaii, and drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping
systems in Hawaii.  Barnwell s oil and
natural gas activities comprise its largest business segment.  Approximately 66% of Barnwell s revenues and
98% of Barnwell s capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2006 were attributable to its oil and natural gas
activities.  Barnwell s land investment
segment revenues accounted for 21% of fiscal 2006 revenues; Barnwell s contract
drilling activities accounted for 10% of fiscal 2006 revenues; and other
revenues comprised 3% of fiscal 2006 revenues.  

   2.              SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

   Cash and
Cash Equivalents   

  Cash
and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term
investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

   Trade
Accounts Receivable   

  Trade
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest.  The allowance for doubtful
accounts is Barnwell s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in
Barnwell s existing accounts receivable and is based on historical write-off
experience.  Account balances are charged
off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and
the potential for recovery is considered remote.  Barnwell does not have any off-balance sheet
credit exposure related to its customers.  

   Oil and
Natural Gas Properties   

  Revenues
associated with the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids are delivered and title has passed to the customer.  

65     

Barnwell
uses the full cost method of accounting under which all costs incurred in the
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves,
including costs related to unsuccessful wells and estimated future site
restoration and abandonment, are capitalized until such time as the aggregate
of such costs net of accumulated depletion and oil and gas related deferred
income taxes, on a country-by-country basis, equals the sum of 1) the
discounted present value (at 10%), using prices as of the end of the fiscal
year on a constant basis, of Barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from
estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as determined by
independent petroleum engineers, less estimated future expenditures to be
incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future
cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations accrued on
the balance sheet; plus 2) the cost of major development projects and unproven
properties not subject to depletion, if any; plus 3) the lower of cost or
estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to
depletion; less 4) related income tax effects. 
If net capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is expensed
unless subsequent market price changes eliminate or reduce the indicated
write-down in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 12D.  Depletion
is computed using the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs, net
of salvage values, plus estimated future costs to develop proved reserves and
satisfy asset retirement obligations, are amortized over the total estimated
proved reserves on a country-by-country basis. 
Investments in major development projects are not depleted until either
proved reserves are associated with the projects or impairment has been
determined.  At September 30, 2006
and 2005, Barnwell had no investments in major oil and natural gas development
projects that were not being depleted. 
General and administrative costs related to oil and natural gas
operations are expensed as incurred. 
Proceeds from the disposition of minor producing oil and natural gas
properties are credited to the cost of oil and natural gas properties.  Gains or losses are recognized on the
disposition of significant oil and natural gas properties.  

   Investment in Land
and Revenue Recognition   

  Barnwell s
investment in land is comprised of development rights under option, rights to
receive percentage of sales payments, and approximately 1,000 acres of vacant
leasehold land zoned conservation, which is under a right of negotiation.  Investment in land is reported at the lower
of the asset carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell, and is evaluated
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
recorded investment balance may not be fully recoverable.  

  Costs
incurred for the acquisition and improvement of leasehold land interests,
including capitalized interest, are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
under the caption  Investment in Land.   

  Sales
of development rights under option and revenues from sales of leasehold land
interests are accounted for pursuant to the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 66,  Accounting for Sales of
Real Estate.   SFAS No. 66 provides
specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sale revenue can be
recorded.  

   Investment in
Affiliate   

  In
June 2006, Barnwell entered into an agreement with Nearco, Inc. ( Nearco ) to
form Mauka 3K, LLC ( Mauka 3K ), for the purpose of providing real
estate consulting services and investing in real estate.  Barnwell and Nearco each have an equal 50%
voting interest in Mauka 3K.  Nearco
is a company controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an
indirect 20.6%  

66     

owner
of Kaupulehu Developments, a general partnership in which Barnwell owns a 77.6%
controlling interest.  

  Barnwell
has evaluated the aforementioned investment in accordance with FASB
Interpretation No. 46,  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,  as
revised, as well as other applicable authoritative accounting literature, and
has determined that the investment in Mauka 3K does not meet the
requirements for consolidation.  Barnwell
accounts for its investment in unconsolidated affiliates under the equity
method when Barnwell s ownership interest is more than 20% but no more than 50%
and Barnwell does not exercise direct or indirect control over the
investee.  Factors that are considered in
determining whether or not Barnwell exercises control include rights of
partners regarding significant strategic and operational decisions.  As Barnwell does not exercise direct or
indirect control over Mauka 3K, the investment is accounted for using the
equity method of accounting.  

  Revenues
from real estate consulting services are recognized when services have been
rendered and the terms of the consulting agreement have been satisfied.  

   Contract Drilling   

  Revenues,
costs and profits applicable to contract drilling contracts are included in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations using the percentage of completion
method, principally measured by the percentage of labor dollars incurred to
date for each contract to total estimated labor dollars for each contract.  Contract losses are recognized in full in the
period the losses are identified.  The
performance of drilling contracts may extend over more than one year and, in
the interim periods, estimates of total contract costs and profits are used to
determine revenues and profits earned for reporting the results of contract
drilling operations.  Revisions in the
estimates required by subsequent performance and final contract settlements are
included as adjustments to the results of operations in the period such
revisions and settlements occur. 
Contracts are normally less than one year in duration.  

   Income Taxes   

  Deferred
income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the
year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.  

  A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Barnwell has established a valuation allowance
primarily for the U.S. tax effect of deferred Canadian taxes, accrued expenses
and state of Hawaii net operating loss carryforwards which may not be
realizable in future years as there can be no assurance of any specific level
of earnings or that the timing of U.S. earnings will coincide with the payment
of Canadian taxes to enable Canadian taxes to be fully deducted (or
recoverable) for U.S. tax purposes.  

   Retirement Plans   

  Barnwell
sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
all of its U.S. employees, with benefits based on years of service and the
employee s highest consecutive  

67     

five-year
average earnings.  Additionally, Barnwell
sponsors a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan, a noncontributory
supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers certain current and former
employees of Barnwell for amounts exceeding the limits allowed under the
pension plan.  Barnwell accounts for its
retirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87,  Employers  Accounting
for Pensions,  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements
be determined on an actuarial basis. 
SFAS No. 87 requires that the effects of the performance of the
pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on
Barnwell s computation of pension income (expense) be amortized over future
periods.  Any variances in the future
between the assumed rates utilized for actuarial purposes and the actual rates
experienced by the plan may materially affect Barnwell s results of operations
or financial condition.  

  During and as of the end of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005,
Barnwell assumed an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8% and
an expected rate of future annual compensation increases of 5%.  

  At the end of each year, Barnwell determines the discount
rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities.  The discount rate is an estimate of the
current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively
settled at the end of the year.  In
estimating this rate, Barnwell looks to rates of return on high-quality,
fixed-income investments.  At
September 30, 2006, Barnwell determined this rate to be 5.50% as compared
to a discount rate of 5.25% used at September 30, 2005.  

   Long-lived Assets   

  Long-lived
assets to be held and used, other than oil and natural gas properties, are
evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.  If the future cash flows expected to result
from use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) are less than
the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized.  Such impairment loss is measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the
asset.  Long-lived assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the asset carrying value or fair value, less
cost to sell.  

  Drilling
rigs, premises and other property and equipment are depreciated using the
straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.  

   Inventories   

  Inventories
are comprised of drilling materials and are valued at the lower of
weighted-average cost or market value.  

   Environmental   

  Barnwell
is subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.  These laws, which are constantly changing,
regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and maintenance of
surface conditions and may require Barnwell to remove or mitigate the
environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances
at various sites.  Environmental
expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic
benefit.  Expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future economic
benefits are expensed.  

68     

Liabilities for
expenditures of a noncapital nature are recorded when environmental assessment
and/or remediation is probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated.  

   Asset Retirement
Obligation   

  Barnwell accounts for asset retirement obligations
in accordance with SFAS No. 143,  Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,  and FASB Interpretation No. 47,  Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations - an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 143,  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. 
Barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil
and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of
oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related
reserves.  The liability is accreted at
the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating
expense.  If an obligation is settled for
other than the carrying amount of the liability, Barnwell will recognize a gain
or loss on settlement.  

  In September 2004, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) released Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 106
which expresses the SEC s views regarding the application of SFAS No. 143,
 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,  by oil and gas producing
companies following the full cost accounting method.  SAB No. 106 addresses the calculation of
ceiling tests for full-cost oil and gas companies, depreciation, depletion and
amortization as affected by the adoption of SFAS No. 143, as well as the
related required disclosures.  Barnwell
adopted the provisions of SAB No. 106 during the year ended
September 30, 2004.  The adoption of
SAB No. 106 had no material impact on Barnwell s financial condition,
results of operations or liquidity.  

   Earnings Per
Common Share   

  In
December 2004, Barnwell s Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split
in the form of a 100% stock dividend. 
The shares were distributed on January 28, 2005 to all shareholders
of record as of January 11, 2005. 
There were 1,361,510 shares outstanding on January 11, 2005 before
the split.  Barnwell issued 1,028,223 of
new shares and utilized 333,287 shares of treasury stock to execute the stock
dividend, resulting in outstanding shares of 2,723,020 following the
split.  Barnwell s common stock began
trading on a split-adjusted basis on January 31, 2005.  

  In
October 2005, Barnwell s Board of Directors declared a three-for-one stock
split in the form of a 200% stock dividend. 
The shares were distributed on November 14, 2005 to all
shareholders of record as of October 28, 2005.  There were 2,723,020 shares outstanding on
October 28, 2005.  Barnwell issued
5,446,040 of new shares to execute the stock dividend, resulting in outstanding
shares of 8,169,060 following the split. 
Barnwell s common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on   November 15,
2005  .  

  All
information in this Form 10-K has been adjusted where necessary to
reflect the stock splits for all periods presented.  

  Basic
earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net earnings
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period.  Diluted earnings per share
includes the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options
and securities which are convertible to common shares.  

69     

Reconciliations
between the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per
share computations for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004
are as follows:  

Share-Based
Compensation   

  Effective
October 1, 2005, Barnwell adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based
Payment,  for its share-based compensation plans, using the modified
prospective transition method.  Barnwell
previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No. 25,  Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,  and related interpretations and disclosure
requirements established by SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,  as amended by SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation   Transition and Disclosure.   

  Under
APB No. 25, no compensation expense was recorded for Barnwell s stock options
issued under the qualified plan.  The pro
forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share for qualified stock
options were instead disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements.  Under APB No. 25, compensation expense
for non-qualified stock options with stock appreciation rights features were
recorded utilizing the market price of Barnwell s stock at each period-end to
determine the vested intrinsic value of the stock appreciation rights.  

  Under
SFAS No. 123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at fair
value.  Barnwell utilizes a closed-form
valuation model to determine the fair value of each option award.  Expected  

70     

volatilities are
based on the historical volatility of Barnwell s stock over a period consistent
with that of the expected terms of the options. 
The expected terms of the options are estimated based on factors such as
vesting periods, contractual expiration dates, historical trends in Barnwell s
stock price, and historical exercise behavior. 
The risk-free rates for periods within the contractual life of the
options are based on the yields of U.S. Treasury instruments with terms
comparable to the estimated option terms.

and liabilities of foreign operations and subsidiaries are translated at the
year-end exchange rate and resulting translation gains or losses are accounted
for in a stockholders  equity account entitled  Accumulated other comprehensive
income, net.   Operating results of
foreign subsidiaries are translated at average exchange rates during the
period.  Realized foreign currency
transaction gains or losses were not material in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and
2004.  

   Use of Estimates
in the Preparation of Financial Statements   

  The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  Actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates.  Significant
assumptions are required in the valuation of deferred tax assets, asset
retirement obligations, share-based payment arrangements, obligations for
retirement plans, contract drilling estimated costs to complete, and proved oil
and natural gas reserves, and such assumptions may impact the amount at which
deferred tax assets and oil and natural gas properties are recorded.

4.              INVESTMENT IN LAND    

   Background   

  Barnwell
owns a 77.6% controlling interest in Kaupulehu Developments, a Hawaii general
partnership that owns interests in leasehold land and development rights for
property located approximately six miles north of the Kona International
Airport in the North Kona District of the Island of Hawaii.  

  Between
1986 and 1989, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning
changes necessary to permit development of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at
Historic Ka upulehu and Hualalai Golf Club, which opened in 1996, a second golf
course, and single-family and multi-family residential units.  These projects were developed on leasehold
land acquired from Kaupulehu Developments by Kaupulehu Makai Venture, an
unrelated entity.  

  Between
1993 and 2001, Kaupulehu Developments obtained the state and county zoning
changes necessary to permit resort/residential development of approximately 870
acres.  

   Sale of Interest
in Leasehold Land   

  In
February 2004, Kaupulehu Developments entered into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement with WB KD Acquisition, LLC ( WB ) by which Kaupulehu Developments
transferred its leasehold interest in the aforementioned 870 acres zoned for
resort/residential development, in two increments, to WB.  There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu
Developments and WB.  WB is affiliated
with Westbrook Partners, the developers of the Kuki o Resort located adjacent
to the Hualalai Resort at Historic Ka upulehu. 
The first increment ( Increment I ) is an area planned for
approximately 80 single-family lots and a beach club on the portion of the
property bordering the Pacific Ocean. 
The purchasers of the 80 single-family lots will have the right to apply
for membership in the Kuki o Resort Golf and Beach Club, which is located
adjacent to and south of the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka upulehu.  The second increment ( Increment II ) is
the remaining portion of the approximately 870-acre property and is zoned for
single-family and multi-family residential units and a golf course and
clubhouse.  

  With respect to Increment I, Kaupulehu
Developments received an $11,550,000 payment in February 2004 and is entitled
to receive payment of the following percentages of the gross proceeds generated
from the sale by WB of single-family lots in Increment I ( Percentage
Payments ): 9% of  

72     

the gross proceeds from single-family lot sales up to aggregate gross
proceeds of $100,000,000; 10% of such aggregate gross proceeds greater than
$100,000,000 but less than $300,000,000; and 14% of such aggregate gross
proceeds in excess of $300,000,000. 
Minimum amounts of these Percentage Payments are due by certain
dates.  WB sold a total of five
single-family lots and paid Kaupulehu Developments $3,660,000 in Percentage
Payments during the year ended September 30, 2006.   Revenue from the Percentage Payments
was reduced by $220,000 of fees related to the sales resulting in net revenues
of $3,440,000 and a $2,688,000 operating profit, after minority interest.   There
were no lot sales, and therefore, no Percentage Payments received during fiscal
2005.  There is no assurance that any
future payments will be received. 

  WB
also agreed to pay Kaupulehu Developments subsequent to February 2004 interim
payments of $50,000 per month ( Interim Payments ) up to a total of
$900,000.  Kaupulehu Developments
received the $900,000 in full as of August 2005.  

  In
June 2006, Kaupulehu Developments entered into an Agreement ( Increment II
Agreement ) with WB and WB KD Acquisition II, LLC ( WBKD ) by which Kaupulehu
Developments sold its interest in Increment II, representing the remainder
of the approximately 870 acres, to WBKD. 
There is no affiliation between Kaupulehu Developments and WB or
WBKD.  WB and WBKD are both affiliates of
Westbrook Partners, developers of the nearby Kuki o Resort.  Pursuant to the Increment II Agreement,
Kaupulehu Developments received a $10,000,000 payment and is entitled to
receive future payments from WBKD based on a percentage of the sales prices of
the residential lots, ranging from 3.25% to 14%, to be determined in the future
depending upon a number of variables, including whether the lots are sold prior
to improvement.  The revenue from the
$10,000,000 payment received in fiscal 2006 was reduced by $600,000 of fees
related to the sale, $220,000 in other costs related to the sale, and
approximately $2,983,000 of previously capitalized costs relating to Increment II,
resulting in net revenues of $6,197,000 and a $4,621,000 operating profit,
after minority interest.  There were no
Increment II Percentage Payments received during the year ended September 30,
2006.  There is no assurance that any
future payments will be received.  

  In
addition, under the terms of the Increment II Agreement, WBKD has the
exclusive right to negotiate with Kaupulehu Developments with respect to Lot
4C, which is comprised of approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land
zoned conservation located adjacent to Increment II.  This right expires in June 2009 or, if WBKD
completes any and all environmental assessments and surveys reasonably required
to support a petition to the Hawaii State Land Use Commission for
reclassification of Lot 4C zoning, in June 2012.  

  The
sales of Kaupulehu Developments  Increment I and Increment II
leasehold land interests in    fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2006, respectively,
were accounted for pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66 which
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sale
revenue can be recorded.  The revenue
recognized in fiscal 2004 from the $11,550,000 payment plus $350,000 of
post-closing Interim Payments, was reduced by $693,000 of fees related to the
sale, approximately $402,000 in other costs related to the sale, and $3,475,000
of previously capitalized costs relating to Increment I resulting in net
revenues of $7,330,000 and an operating profit, after minority interest, of
approximately $5,470,000.  During fiscal
2005, Kaupulehu Developments received additional Interim Payments, before
minority interest, totaling $550,000. 
The revenue recognized in fiscal 2006 from the $10,000,000
Increment II payment and the $3,660,000 of Percentage Payments received on
the Increment I lot sales was reduced by $820,000 of fees related to the
sale, $220,000 in other costs related to the sales, and approximately
$2,983,000 of previously capitalized costs relating to Increment II
resulting in net revenues of $9,637,000 and an operating profit, after minority
interest, of  

73     

approximately
$7,309,000.  The Increment I,
Increment II and Interim Payment revenues, net of related fees and other
costs, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Sale of
interest in leasehold land, net.   

   Development Rights
Under Option   

  The development
rights held by Kaupulehu Developments are for residentially-zoned leasehold
land within and adjacent to the Hualalai Golf Club and the second golf course
and are under option to Kaupulehu Makai Venture, an unrelated entity.  Sales of Kaupulehu Developments  development
rights are accounted for pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66 which
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sale
revenue can be recorded.  In December   2003
and 2004, Kaupulehu Makai Venture exercised the portion of its development
rights option then due and paid Kaupulehu Developments non-refundable payments
of $2,656,000 in both fiscal 2005 and 2004.  In November 2005, Kaupulehu
Makai Venture paid Kaupulehu Developments a non-refundable payment of
$2,875,000 upon exercising its development rights option due on
December 31, 2005 of $2,656,250 and a $218,750 portion of its development
rights option due on December 31, 2006.  In
each of fiscal years 2005 and 2004, $2,656,000 of revenues attributable to the
development rights sale were reduced by $159,000 of fees related to the sale,
resulting in net revenues of $2,497,000 and a $1,950,000 operating profit,
after minority interest, on the transactions. 
In fiscal 2006, the $2,875,000 development rights option revenues was
reduced by $173,000 of fees related to the sale, resulting in net revenues of
$2,702,000 and an operating profit, after minority interest, of
$2,111,000.  There were no other costs
deducted from revenues from the sale of development rights in fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004 as all capitalized costs associated with the development rights were
expensed in previous years.  The
development rights option revenues, net of related fees, are recorded in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Sale of development rights, net.   

  The total amount of remaining future development
rights option receipts at September 30, 2006, if all options are fully
exercised, is $13,062,500, comprised of the balance of $2,437,500 due on
December 31, 2006 and four payments of $2,656,250 due on each
December 31 of years 2007 to 2010. 
If any annual option payment is not made, the then remaining development
right options will expire.  There is no
assurance that any portion of the remaining options will be exercised.  

   Fees   

  The
aforementioned $173,000 in fees ($121,000 net of minority interest) on the
$2,875,000 development rights proceeds and the $820,000 in fees ($575,000 net
of minority interest) on the Percentage Payments and Increment II payment
proceeds received in fiscal 2006, as well as the $159,000 in fees ($112,000,
net of minority interest) on the proceeds from the sale of development rights
in fiscal 2005 and 2004, and the $693,000 in fees ($486,000, net of minority interest)
on the proceeds from the closing and Interim Payments received for the sale of
interest in leasehold land in the year ended September 30, 2004 were paid
to Nearco, Inc. ( Nearco ), a company controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a
director of Barnwell and an indirect 20.6% owner of Kaupulehu
Developments.  Under an agreement entered
into in 1987, prior to Mr. Johnston s election to Barnwell s Board of
Directors, Barnwell is obligated to pay Nearco 2% of Kaupulehu Developments 
gross receipts from real estate transactions, and Cambridge Hawaii Limited
Partnership, a 49.9% partner of Kaupulehu Developments in which Barnwell
purchased a 55.2% interest in April 2001, is obligated under an agreement
entered into in 1987 to pay Nearco 4% of Kaupulehu Developments  gross receipts
from real estate transactions.  The fees
represent compensation for promotion and marketing of Kaupulehu Developments 
property and were determined based on the estimated fair value of such
services.  

74  

Fees were also paid to Nearco for consulting
services related to Kaupulehu Developments  leasehold land.  In fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, consulting
service fees paid to Nearco totaled $76,000, $268,000 and $273,000,
respectively, and were included in general and administrative expenses.  In addition, $52,000 of fees was paid to
Nearco in fiscal 2004 for services related to the closing of the February 2004
sale of an interest in leasehold land. 
These fees were a direct cost of the sale and accordingly reduced the
revenues recognized from the sale.  

   Interests at
September 30, 2006   

  The
interests held by Kaupulehu Developments at September 30, 2006 include the
development rights under option, the rights to receive percentage of sales
payments on Increment I and Increment II of the two increments of the 870
acres, and approximately 1,000 acres of vacant leasehold land zoned
conservation, which is under a right of negotiation with WBKD.  There is no assurance that any future development
rights option payments or percentage of sales payments will be received, nor is
there any assurance that WBKD will enter into an agreement with Kaupulehu
Developments regarding Lot 4C.  These
interests relate to land within and adjacent to the Hualalai Resort at Historic
Ka upulehu, between the Queen Kaahumanu Highway and the Pacific Ocean.  Barnwell s cost of Kaupulehu Developments 
interests is included in the September 30, 2006 and 2005 Consolidated Balance
Sheets under the caption  Investment in Land  and consists of the following
amounts:  

5.                                            INVESTMENT
IN AFFILIATE   

  In June 2006, Barnwell entered into an agreement
with Nearco to form Mauka 3K, LLC ( Mauka 3K ), for the purpose of
providing real estate consulting services and investing in real estate.  Barnwell and Nearco each have an equal 50%
voting interest in Mauka 3K.  Nearco
is a company controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an
indirect 20.6% owner of Kaupulehu Developments, a general partnership in which
Barnwell owns a 77.6% controlling interest. 
Barnwell does not have a controlling interest in Mauka 3K and thus
accounts for its investment utilizing the equity method of accounting.  Under the equity method of accounting,
Barnwell s proportionate share of its affiliate s income is included in equity
in earnings of real estate affiliate.  

  In September 2006 Barnwell received net proceeds
of $1,440,000 representing its share of real estate consulting revenues, less
related expenses.  The net proceeds are
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as  Equity in earnings
of real estate affiliate, net of tax.  
The tax provision related to equity in earnings of real estate affiliate
was $545,000 in fiscal 2006.  

75     

Revenues from real estate consulting services
are recognized when services have been rendered and the terms of the consulting
agreement have been satisfied.  

   6.                                            PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION   

  Barnwell s
property and equipment is detailed as follows:  

Based
on a natural gas spot price of $3.34 per 1,000 cubic feet ( MCF ) as of
September 30, 2006, the full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation by
approximately $1,581,000.  However,
natural gas prices increased significantly subsequent to September 30,
2006, but prior to the filing of this annual report, such that Barnwell s full
cost pool would not have exceeded the ceiling limitation.  The spot price of natural gas on
December 18, 2006 was approximately $6.30 per MCF, which represents an 89%
increase over the September 30, 2006 spot price of $3.34 per MCF.  Accordingly, per U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12D, Barnwell has not recorded an
impairment write-down of its oil and natural gas properties at
September 30, 2006.  

  In
October 2004, the Government of Alberta enacted amendments to the Natural Gas
Royalty Regulation which provide a mechanism to reduce royalties calculated
through the Crown royalty system for operators of gas wells which have been
denied the right to produce by the Alberta Energy Utilities Board as a result of
recent bitumen conservation decisions. 
In December 2004, royalty reductions were effected by the Alberta
Department of Energy s Information Letter 2004-36 which  

76     

sets out the
details of the royalty adjustment, the impact on the existing temporary assistance
received to date by affected gas well operators, the provisions for potential
recapture of the royalty adjustments, and continuation of impacted petroleum
and natural gas agreements.  Barnwell
received a total of approximately $347,000 and $558,000 related to the
aforementioned royalty adjustments for wells in the Thornbury area in fiscal
years 2006 and 2005, respectively.  It is
Barnwell s estimation that the subject Thornbury wells will not recommence
production, thus no returns to the Government of Alberta of the royalty
adjustments received would be required under the recapture provisions.  Accordingly, the receipts are payments for
deemed production by the Government of Alberta to Barnwell for condemnation of
the wells, and such receipts were credited to oil and natural gas properties
for book purposes.  

  On
October 1, 2002, Barnwell adopted SFAS
No. 143,  Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,  which requires
that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of
fair value can be made.  Adoption of SFAS
No. 143 increased gross oil and natural gas properties by $564,000,
decreased accumulated depletion by $546,000, and increased the asset retirement
obligation by $1,110,000 on October 1, 2002.  Following the initial implementation
of SFAS No. 143, the asset retirement obligation was increased during the
year ended September 30, 2003 by $39,000 to reflect obligations incurred
on new wells drilled, by $85,000 for accretion of the asset retirement
obligation, and by $198,000 for changes in foreign currency translation
rates.  During the year ended
September 30, 2004, the asset retirement obligation was increased by
$133,000 to reflect obligations incurred on new wells drilled and changes in
the timing and amount of estimated future expenditures, by $100,000 for
accretion of the asset retirement obligation, and by $110,000 for changes in
foreign currency translation rates. 
During the year ended September 30, 2005, the asset retirement
obligation was increased by $221,000 to reflect obligations incurred on new
wells drilled, $545,000 for changes in the timing and amount of estimated
future expenditures, $140,000 for accretion of the asset retirement obligation,
and by $164,000 for changes in foreign currency translation rates.  The changes due to the timing and amount of
estimated future expenditures primarily resulted from an increase in the
inflation-adjusted cost of abandonment and restoration services, due in part to
recent rises in oil and natural gas prices.  

  During
the year ended September 30, 2006, the asset retirement obligation was
increased by $303,000 to reflect obligations incurred on new wells drilled,
$302,000 for changes in the timing and amount of estimated future expenditures,
$199,000 for accretion of the asset retirement obligation, and by $124,000 for
changes in foreign currency translation rates. 
The changes due to the timing and amount of estimated future
expenditures primarily resulted from an increase in the inflation-adjusted cost
of abandonment and restoration services, due in part to recent rises in oil and
natural gas prices.  The increase was
partially offset by $20,000 in abandonment and restoration disbursements in
fiscal 2006.  

   7.                                            LONG-TERM
DEBT   

  Barnwell
has a credit facility at Royal Bank of Canada, a Canadian bank, for
approximately $17,932,000 at September 30, 2006.  Borrowings under this facility were
$11,735,000 and $11,576,000 at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
and are included in long-term debt.  At
September 30, 2006, Barnwell had unused credit available under this
facility of approximately $6,197,000.  

77     

The
facility is available in U.S. dollars at the London Interbank Offer Rate plus
2%, at U.S. prime plus 1%, or in Canadian dollars at Canadian prime plus
1%.  A standby fee of 0.5% per annum is
charged on the unused facility balance. 
Under the financing agreement, the facility is reviewed annually, with
the next review planned for April 2007. 
Subject to that review, the facility may be extended one year with no
required debt repayments for one year or converted to a two-year term loan by
the bank.  The primary focus of the
annual review is on the future cash flows that will be generated by Barnwell s
Canadian oil and natural gas properties. 
Additionally, Royal Bank of Canada may adjust the total amount of the
credit facility during its next review. 
If the facility is converted to a two-year term loan, Barnwell has
agreed to the following repayment schedule of the then outstanding loan
balance:  first year of the term period  
20% (5% per quarter), and in the second year of the term period   80% (5% per
quarter for the first three quarters and 65% in the final quarter).  

  Barnwell
has the option to change the currency denomination and interest rate applicable
to the loan at periodic intervals during the term of the loan.  During the year ended September 30,
2006, Barnwell paid interest at rates ranging from 5.841% to 7.400%.  The weighted-average interest rate on the facility
at September 30, 2006 was 7.217%. 
The facility is collateralized by Barnwell s interests in its major oil
and natural gas properties and a pledge not to otherwise pledge on its
remaining oil and natural gas properties. 
The facility is guaranteed by Barnwell Industries, Inc.  No compensating bank balances are required
for this facility.  

  The
bank affirmed that it will not require any repayments under the facility before
October 1, 2007.  Accordingly,
Barnwell has classified outstanding borrowings under the facility as long-term
debt.  

  Interest
costs amounted to $833,000, $616,000 and $487,000 for the years ended
September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  

   8.                                            TAXES
ON INCOME   

  The
components of earnings before income taxes are as follows:  

78     

The
components of the provision for income taxes related to the above earnings
(loss) are as follows:  

Included in the
provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 is a Canadian deferred tax benefit
of $1,094,000 resulting from a reduction in Canadian tax rates.  In May 2006, a bill reducing the Province of
Alberta s corporate tax rate from 11.5% to 10.0% effective April 1, 2006
received Royal Assent and was passed into law. 
In June 2006, Royal Assent was received on a bill passed by the
Parliament of Canada which reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 19%
from 21% by 2010 starting January 1, 2008. 
The federal corporate surtax will also be eliminated effective January
1, 2008.  Accordingly, Barnwell s
Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were reduced in fiscal 2006 as a
result of these reductions in Canadian tax rates.  

  Also included in
the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2006 is the recognition of a deferred
income tax benefit of $4,130,000 due to a reduction in the valuation allowance
for foreign tax credit carryforwards. 
The acceleration of Barnwell s investments in Canadian oil and natural
gas properties beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, coupled with
Kaupulehu Developments  receipt of proceeds related to Increment I, resulted in
the determination that it was more likely than not that fiscal 2006 and future
years  taxable income from Canadian operations under U.S. tax law will exceed
taxable income from Canadian operations under Canadian tax law to a degree that
will result in the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards to reduce
U.S. taxes.  This is primarily
attributable to differences in the statutory deduction rates for Barnwell s
Canadian oil and natural gas capital expenditures under Canadian tax law as compared
to such deductions under U.S. tax law. 
There were no reductions in the valuation allowance for foreign tax
credit carryforwards in the years ended September 30, 2005 or 2004.  Approximately $2,600,000 of foreign tax
credit carryforwards will be utilized to reduce U.S. income taxes for fiscal
2006.  Barnwell s estimates of the tax
effects of temporary differences under both Canadian tax jurisdiction and U.S.
tax jurisdiction that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities and
estimates of deferred tax asset valuation allowances require subjective
assumptions including, among others, estimates of Canadian taxable income, U.S.
taxable income and Canadian capital expenditures in future years.  

  Effective for tax years
beginning after December 31, 2004, the 90 percent limitation on using the
alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit to offset alternative minimum taxes
was repealed by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  Accordingly, beginning in fiscal 2006,
Barnwell is permitted to  

79     

use the full alternative
minimum tax foreign tax credit to offset alternative minimum taxes on foreign
source income, notwithstanding any other limitations which may apply.  

  Barnwell s U.S.
deferred tax benefit of $1,338,000 for fiscal 2005 is primarily the result of increases
in stock appreciation rights accruals, bonus accruals, the excess of depletion
and depreciation for book purposes over tax, and alternative minimum tax
credits generated during the year which are estimated to have future tax
benefits.  

  Included
in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2004 is a $1,740,000 deferred tax
benefit resulting from reductions in Canadian federal and provincial tax rates,
partially offset by Barnwell s $825,000 Canadian deferred tax provision
resulting from changes in differences between Canadian assets and liabilities
for book purposes versus Canadian assets and liabilities for Canadian tax
purposes.  In November 2003, Royal Assent
was received on a bill passed by the Parliament of Canada, which was then
enacted into law, to reduce Canada s corporate tax rate on  resource  income
(income derived from oil and natural gas operations) over a four-year period
beginning January 1, 2003 from 29% to 21% beginning January 1,
2007.  Additionally, the bill phases in
over the same four-year period tax deductions for royalties, which previously
were not tax deductible, and phases out the Resource Allowance deduction along
with other changes.  Accordingly, during
fiscal 2004, Barnwell s Canadian net deferred income tax liabilities were
reduced by approximately $1,440,000 due to the reduction in Canada s federal
corporate tax rate.  Barnwell s Canadian
net deferred income tax liabilities were also reduced by approximately $300,000
in fiscal 2004 as a result of the Province of Alberta s reduction of the
province s corporate tax rate from 13.0% to 12.5%, effective April 1, 2003
(enacted into law in December 2003), and from 12.5% to 11.5%, effective
April 1, 2004 (enacted into law in May 2004).  

  A
reconciliation between the reported provision for income taxes and the amount
computed by multiplying the earnings before income taxes by the U.S. federal
tax rate of 35% is as follows:  

80     

Equity
in earnings of real estate affiliate is shown net of income taxes in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2006.  The tax provision relating to equity in
earnings of real estate affiliate was $545,000 in fiscal 2006, representing a
38% effective tax rate.  

  The
tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of
the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at September 30, 2006 and
2005 are as follows:  

The total valuation allowance decreased
$3,544,000 and $929,000 for the years ended September 30, 2006 and
2004, respectively, and increased $1,247,000 for the year ended
September 30, 2005.   
The change in the valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 relates primarily
to the abovementioned reduction of the valuation allowance previously placed on
foreign tax credit carryforwards, partially offset by an increase in the
valuation allowance for the U.S. tax effect of deferred Canadian taxes.  The change in the valuation allowance in
fiscal 2005 was due to an increase in stock appreciation rights accruals for a
Canadian employee for which it is more likely than not that such accruals will
not be utilized in the future to reduce Barnwell s U.S. tax obligation.  The change in the valuation allowance in
fiscal 2004 was due to a decrease in foreign tax credit carryforwards as a
result of the expiration of a portion of the carryforwards.  

  A
valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Barnwell has established a valuation
allowance primarily for the U.S. tax effect of deferred Canadian taxes, accrued
expenses and state of Hawaii net operating loss carryforwards which may not be
realizable in future years as there can be no assurance of any specific  

81     

level of earnings
or that the timing of U.S. earnings will coincide with the payment of Canadian
taxes to enable Canadian taxes to be fully deducted (or recoverable) for U.S.
tax purposes.  

  Net
deferred tax assets at September 30, 2006 of $5,429,000 consists of
$3,293,000 related to expenses accrued for book purposes but not for tax
purposes, $614,000 related to the excess of the cost basis of investment in
land for tax purposes over the cost basis of investment in land for book
purposes, and $1,522,000 for foreign tax credit carryforwards.  Canadian deferred tax assets related to
expenses accrued for book purposes but not for tax purposes are estimated to be
realized through future Canadian income tax deductions against future Canadian
oil and natural gas earnings.  U.S.
deferred tax assets related to expenses accrued for book purposes but not for
tax purposes and the excess of the cost basis of investment in land for tax
purposes over the cost basis of investment in land for book purposes are
estimated to be realized from deductions against future U.S. earnings from land
sale Percentage Payments, sales of interests in leasehold land, and sales of
land development rights.  Foreign tax
credit carryforwards are estimated to be utilized when U.S. federal income
taxes otherwise due on Canadian source income in a given year exceeds the
foreign tax credit generated in that year. 
The foreign tax credit carryforward expires if not utilized on or before
September 30, 2011.  The amount of
deferred income tax assets considered realizable may be reduced if estimates of
future taxable income are reduced.  

   9.                                            RETIREMENT
PLANS    

  Barnwell
sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
all of its U.S. employees, with benefits based on years of service and the
employee s highest consecutive five-year average earnings.  Barnwell s funding policy is intended to
provide for both benefits attributed to service to date and for those expected
to be earned in the future.  In addition,
Barnwell sponsors a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan ( SERP ), a
noncontributory supplemental retirement benefit plan which covers certain
current and former employees of Barnwell for amounts exceeding the limits
allowed under the defined benefit pension plan. 
Barnwell recorded $95,000, $85,000 and $64,000 in expense associated
with the SERP for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.  The plan is unfunded and
Barnwell will fund benefits when payments are made.  The total liability for the SERP was $499,000
and $410,000 at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

  The
overall investment objective of the defined benefit pension plan is to provide
growth in the assets of the plan to fund future benefit obligations while
managing risk in order to meet current benefit obligations.  Generally, principal repayments and interest
received on government mortgage securities provide cash flows to fund current
benefit obligations.  Longer-term
obligations are generally estimated to be provided for by growth in equity
securities.  The plan assets at
September 30, 2006 were invested as follows: 1% in cash, 18% in
certificates of deposit, 28% in debt securities, and 53% in equity
securities.  The plan assets at
September 30, 2005 were invested as follows: 3% in cash, 3% in a
certificate of deposit, 41% in debt securities, and 53% in equity
securities.  Target asset allocations are
not used, and allocations are adjusted from time to time as dictated by current
and anticipated market conditions and required cash flows.  

  Barnwell
contributed $1,050,000 to the pension plan in fiscal 2006 resulting in a
prepaid pension cost of $234,000 at September 30, 2006.  For the year ended September 30, 2006,
Barnwell recognized a net periodic benefit cost of $299,000.  There was no additional minimum liability as
of September 30, 2006.  Fluctuations in
actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest  

82     

rates
will result in changes in the market value of plan assets and may result in
increased or decreased retirement benefits costs and contributions in future
periods.  

  The
measurement date used to determine pension measures for the pension plan is
September 30.  

  The
funded status of the pension plan and the amounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements are as follows:  

The accumulated
benefit obligation for the pension plan was $2,992,000 and $2,978,000 at
September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
SFAS No. 132 requires the recognition of a minimum liability equal
to the excess, if any, of the accumulated benefit obligation over plan assets.  At September 30, 2005, Barnwell
recognized an additional minimum liability of $132,000 as the accrued benefit
cost was less than the minimum liability. 
The increase in the additional minimum liability during the year ended
September 30, 2005 was included in other comprehensive income; there was
no additional minimum liability as of September 30, 2006.  

  The actuarial gain of
$244,000 reported above in the  Change in Benefit Obligation  for the year
ended September 30, 2006 is principally due to an increase in the discount rate
from 5.25% at September 30, 2005 to 5.50% September 30, 2006.  

83     

To
develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, historical
returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class were
considered.  

Barnwell
estimates that it will contribute approximately $500,000 to the plan during
fiscal 2007.  

  In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,  Employers  Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans   an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).  
SFAS No. 158 requires an employer to recognize the over-funded or
under-funded status  

84     

of
a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a multiemployer plan) as an
asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize
changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
comprehensive income.  SFAS No. 158
also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as
of the date of the employer s fiscal year-end statement of financial position
(with limited exceptions).  Under SFAS
No. 158, Barnwell will be required to recognize the funded status of its
defined benefit postretirement plan and supplemental employee retirement plan
and to provide the required disclosures. 
SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2006.  If SFAS
No. 158 were applied as of September 30, 2006, Barnwell would have
recognized an additional pension and other postretirement benefit obligation of
approximately $1,500,000 along with a corresponding decrease in accumulated other
comprehensive income of approximately $990,000, net of $510,000 of deferred
income tax benefits associated with the temporary difference between pension
and postretirement liabilities recognized for book versus tax purposes.  

   10.                                     SHARE-BASED
PAYMENTS   

  Barnwell has
outstanding stock options issued to certain employees under both a qualified
plan approved by shareholders (the 1998 Stock Option Plan) and non-qualified
plans.  The qualified options were
granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of Barnwell s stock on
the date of grant (110% of market price at date of grant for options granted to
affiliates), vest annually over four years of continuous service, and expire
ten years from the date of grant (five years from date of grant for options
granted to affiliates).  The qualified
plan permits the grant of share options to employees for up to 780,000 shares
of common stock.  A total of 774,000
share options have been granted under this plan, leaving 6,000 option shares
available for grant under the qualified plan at September 30, 2006.  The non-qualified options were granted with
an exercise price equal to the market price of Barnwell s stock on the date of
grant, vest annually over five years of continuous service, and expire ten
years from the date of grant.  The
non-qualified options have stock appreciation rights features that permit the
holder to receive stock, cash or a combination thereof equal to the amount by
which the fair market value, at the time of exercise of the option, exceeds the
option price.  Barnwell currently has a
policy of issuing new shares to satisfy share option exercises under the
qualified plan and under the non-qualified plans when the optionee requests
shares.  

  Effective October
1, 2005, Barnwell adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),  Share-Based
Payment,  for its share-based compensation plans.  Barnwell previously accounted for these plans
under the recognition and measurement principles of APB No. 25,  Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,  and related interpretations and disclosure
requirements established by SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,  as amended by SFAS No. 148,  Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation   Transition and Disclosure.   

  Under SFAS No.
123(R), share-based compensation cost is measured at fair value.  Barnwell utilizes a closed-form valuation
model to determine the fair value of each option award.  Expected volatilities are based on the historical
volatility of Barnwell s stock over a period consistent with that of the
expected terms of the options.  The
expected terms of the options are estimated based on factors such as vesting
periods, contractual expiration dates, historical trends in Barnwell s stock
price, and historical exercise behavior. 
The risk-free rates for periods within the contractual life of the
options are based on the yields of U.S. Treasury instruments with terms
comparable to the estimated option terms. 
Share-based compensation expense recognized in earnings for the year
ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 are reflected in  General and administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Statements  

85     

of Operations.  

   Equity-classified
Awards   

  Compensation cost
for equity-classified awards, such as Barnwell s stock options issued under the
qualified plan, is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and is recognized as an expense in earnings over the requisite service
period using a graded vesting method. 
Total share-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards
vested in the year ended September 30, 2006 was $144,000.  There was no impact on income taxes as the
expense relates to qualified options. 
There were no qualified option grants, exercises, expirations, or
forfeitures in the year ended September 30, 2006.  There was no share-based compensation expense
for equity-classified awards vested in the year ended September 30, 2005.  

  A summary of
equity-classified share options as of the beginning and end of the year ended
September 30, 2006 is presented below:  

Liability-classified
Awards   

  The following
assumptions were used in estimating fair value for all liability-classified
share options previously granted prior to October 1, 2005 and outstanding
during the year ended September 30, 2006 (there were no options granted in
fiscal 2006):  

Compensation cost for liability-classified awards,
such as Barnwell s non-qualified stock options with stock appreciation rights
features, is remeasured at each period-end using a closed-form valuation model
based on current values and is recognized as an expense over the requisite
service period.  Total share-based
compensation expense for liability-classified awards was $439,000 for the year
ended September 30, 2006.  The
related income tax benefit was $146,000 for the year ended September 30,
2006.  Included in share-based
compensation expense for liability-classified awards for the year ended September 30,
2006 was $740,000 of compensation expense related to shares that vested during
the year and $301,000 of compensation benefit due to remeasurement at September 30,
2006 of the fair value of previously vested shares.  

86  

During the year ended  September 30 , 2006, an officer and an officer/director
exercised the stock appreciation rights feature of 60,000 and 30,000 shares,
respectively, of non-qualified options and $1,160,000 and $489,000,
respectively, representing the differences between the exercise prices and the
closing prices per share on the days prior to the dates of exercise were paid
to the officer and officer/director, respectively, in cash by Barnwell.  The actual tax benefits realized for the tax
deductions of these exercises were $406,000 and $171,000, respectively, for the
year ended September 30,
2006.  There were no other
liability-classified share option grants, exercises, expirations, or
forfeitures in the year ended September 30, 2006. 

  A
summary of liability-classified share options as of the beginning and end of
the year ended September 30, 2006 is presented below:  

As
of September 30, 2006, there was $944,000 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested equity-classified and
liability-classified share options.  That
cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7
years.  Total share-based compensation
expense related to the vesting of awards in the year ended September 30,
2006 was $884,000.  Total share-based
compensation expense for all awards, including the impact of changes in fair
values for liability-classified awards, and the income tax benefit on total
compensation expense for all awards was $583,000 and $146,000, respectively,
for the year ended September 30, 2006.  

  Barnwell
adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method.  Under this transition method, compensation
cost recognized in the year ended September 30, 2006 includes the cost for
equity-classified share options vested during the period and all vested
liability-classified share-based awards granted prior to October 1, 2005,
as determined under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R).  Share-based compensation cost for the year
ended September 30, 2006 is reported in  General and administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  The cumulative effect, net of income taxes,
of the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on liability-classified
awards was not material to the consolidated financial statements.  Results for prior periods have not been
restated.  

87     

The
following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share
as if the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 were applied
to all of its share-based compensation awards for the prior year periods:  

Fair
value measurement of options without stock appreciation rights that are
included in fiscal 2005 pro forma net earnings was based on an option-pricing
model which included assumptions of a weighted-average expected life of 5.57
years, expected volatility of 25%, risk-free interest rate of 4%, and an
expected dividend yield of 1%.  Fair
value measurement of options without stock appreciation rights that are
included in fiscal 2004 pro forma net earnings was based on an option-pricing
model which included assumptions of a weighted-average expected life of 6.40
years, expected volatility of 30%, risk-free interest rate of 6.3%, and an
expected dividend yield of 0%.  

  In
December 2004, 210,000 equity-classified option shares were granted at a
weighted-average grant-date fair value of $2.18.  The total intrinsic value of equity options
exercised during the year ended September 30, 2005 was $1,384,000; there
were no expirations or forfeitures of equity-classified options during the year
ended September 30, 2005.  

  In
December 2004, Barnwell granted stock options to certain officers/directors of
Barnwell to acquire 210,000 shares of Barnwell s common stock under a
non-qualified plan at a purchase price of $8.80 per share (market price on date
of grant).  These options have stock
appreciation rights that  

88     

permit the holder to receive stock, cash or a combination
thereof equal to the amount by which the fair market value, at the time of
exercise of the option, exceeds the option price.  

  In
March 1995, Barnwell granted 120,000 stock options to an officer/director of
Barnwell under a non-qualified plan at a purchase price of $3.27 per share
(market price on date of grant).  These
options had stock appreciation rights that permitted the holder to receive
stock, cash or a combination thereof equal to the amount by which the fair
market value, at the time of exercise of the option, exceeds the option
price.  During the year ended
September 30, 2004, the officer/director exercised the stock appreciation
rights feature of 78,000 shares of these options and $310,000, representing the
difference between the exercise price and the closing prices per share on the
days prior to the dates of exercise was paid to this employee in cash by
Barnwell.  During the year ended
September 30, 2005, the officer/director exercised the stock appreciation
rights feature of 42,000 shares of these options and $463,000, representing the
difference between the exercise price and the closing price per share on the
day prior to the date of exercise was paid to this officer/director in cash by
Barnwell.  Barnwell recognized $275,000
and $392,000 of compensation cost relating to these options in the years ended
September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  

  In
June 1998, Barnwell granted 180,000 stock options to an officer of Barnwell s
oil and gas segment under a non-qualified plan at a purchase price of $2.60 per
share (market price on date of grant). 
These options are fully vested and have stock appreciation rights that
permit the holder to receive stock, cash or a combination thereof equal to the
amount by which the fair market value, at the time of exercise of the option,
exceeds the option price.  During the
year ended September 30, 2006, the officer exercised the stock
appreciation rights feature on 60,000 shares of these options and the
difference between the exercise price and the closing price per share on the
day prior to the date of exercise ($21.93 per share) was paid to this officer
in cash by Barnwell.  The remaining
120,000 options expire in May 2008. 
Barnwell recognized a compensation benefit of $359,000 relating to these
options in fiscal 2006 and $2,223,000 and $599,000 of compensation costs in the
years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  

  In
December 1999, Barnwell granted qualified stock options to certain employees of
Barnwell to acquire 408,000 shares and 174,000 shares of Barnwell s common
stock with an exercise price per share of $1.98 (market price at date of grant)
and $2.18 (110% of market price at date of grant), respectively.  These options are fully vested.  The $1.98 per share options expire in
December 2009, and the $2.18 per share options expired in December 2004.  During the years ended September 30,
2005 and 2004, Barnwell issued 207,000 shares and 105,000 shares, respectively,
of its common stock to certain employees resulting from exercises of qualified
stock options at exercise prices ranging from $1.98 to $2.18 per share.  No compensation cost was recognized for these
options for the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004.  

  In December 2004,
Barnwell granted qualified stock options to certain officers/directors of
Barnwell to acquire 210,000 shares of Barnwell s common stock at a weighted-average
exercise price per share of $9.23 (based on grants at market price and 110% of
market price at the date of grant). 
These options vest annually over four years commencing one year from the
date of grant and expire in December 2014 and December 2009.  No compensation cost was recognized for
options granted under this plan for the year ended September 30, 2005.  At September 30, 2005, 6,000 shares were
available for grant under the qualified option plan.  

  In
December 2004, Barnwell granted stock options to certain officers/directors of
Barnwell to acquire 210,000 shares of Barnwell s common stock under a
non-qualified plan at a purchase price of  

89     

$8.80 per share
(market price on date of grant).  These
options vest annually over five years commencing one year from the date of
grant and expire in December 2014.  These
options have stock appreciation rights that permit the holder to receive stock,
cash or a combination thereof equal to the amount by which the fair market
value, at the time of exercise of the option, exceeds the option price.  During the year ended September 30,
2006, an officer/director exercised the stock appreciation rights feature on
30,000 shares of these options and the difference between the exercise price
and the closing price per share on the day prior to the date of exercise
($25.10 per share) was paid to this officer/director in cash by Barnwell.  Barnwell recognized $798,000 and $1,001,000
of compensation costs relating to these options in the years ended
September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

  There were no forfeitures or expirations
of unexercised options in the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and
2004.  

  Barnwell plans to repurchase shares of
its common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions, depending on market conditions. 
In December 2005, Barnwell s Board of Directors authorized the purchase
of up to 250,000 shares.  

   11.           COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES    

  Barnwell
has committed to compensate its Vice President of Canadian Operations pursuant
to an incentive compensation plan, the value of which directly relates to
Barnwell s oil and natural gas segment s net income and the change in the value
of Barnwell s oil and gas reserves since 1998 with adjustments for changes in
natural gas and oil prices and subject to other terms and conditions.  Barnwell recognized $18,000, $131,000 and
$60,000 of compensation expense pursuant to this incentive plan in fiscal 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively.  

  Barnwell has also committed to compensate certain
Canadian personnel pursuant to an incentive compensation plan, the value of
which directly relates to Barnwell s oil and natural gas segment s net income
and the value of Barnwell s oil and gas reserves discovered, commencing in
fiscal 2002, for projects developed by such personnel.  Barnwell recognized approximately $359,000,
$90,000 and $190,000 of costs pursuant to this plan in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.  

   Barnwell has several non-cancelable operating
leases for office space and leasehold land. 
Rental expense was $528,000 in 2006, $481,000 in 2005, and $444,000 in
2004.  Barnwell is committed under these
leases for minimum rental payments summarized by fiscal year as follows: 2007 -
$571,000, 2008 - $502,000, 2009 - $437,000, 2010 - $437,000, 2011 - $430,000
and thereafter through 2026 an aggregate of $1,685,000.  The lease payments for land were subject to
renegotiation as of January 1, 2006. 
 Per the lease agreement, the lease payments will remain unchanged
pending an appraisal, whereupon the lease rent could be adjusted to fair market
value .  Barnwell does not know the amount of the new
lease payments which could be effective upon performance of the appraisal; they
may remain unchanged or increase, and Barnwell currently expects the adjustment,
if any, to not be material.  The future
rental payment disclosures above assume the minimum lease payments for land in
effect at December 31, 2005 remain unchanged through December 2025, the
end of the lease term. 

  Barnwell
is committed to pay commissions to Nearco, Inc. ( Nearco ), a company
controlled by Mr. Terry Johnston, a director of Barnwell and an indirect 20.6%
owner of Kaupulehu Developments.  Under
an agreement entered into in 1987, prior to Mr. Johnston s election to Barnwell s
Board of Directors, Barnwell is obligated to pay Nearco 2% of Kaupulehu
Developments   

90     

gross
receipts from real estate transactions, and Cambridge Hawaii Limited
Partnership, a 49.9% partner of Kaupulehu Developments in which Barnwell
purchased a 55.2% interest in April 2001, is obligated under an agreement
entered into in 1987 to pay Nearco 4% of Kaupulehu Developments  gross receipts
from real estate transactions.  The fees
represent compensation for promotion and marketing of Kaupulehu Developments 
property and were determined based on the estimated fair value of such
services.  

  In
conjunction with the closing of the Increment II transaction in fiscal 2006,
Kaupulehu Developments entered into an agreement to pay its external real
estate legal counsel 1.5% of all Increment II Percentage Payments received by
Kaupulehu Developments for services provided by its external real estate legal
counsel in the negotiation and closing of the Increment II transaction.  No amounts were paid pursuant to this
arrangement in fiscal 2006.  

  Barnwell
is occasionally involved in routine litigation and is subject to governmental
and regulatory controls that are incidental to the ordinary course of
business.  Barnwell s management believes
that all claims and litigation involving Barnwell are not likely to have a
material adverse effect on its financial statements taken as a whole.  

   12.           SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION    

  Barnwell
operates three segments: exploring for, developing, producing and selling oil
and natural gas (oil and natural gas); investing in leasehold land in Hawaii
(land investment); and drilling wells and installing and repairing water
pumping systems in Hawaii (contract drilling). 
Barnwell s reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services.  They
are managed separately as each segment requires different operational methods,
operational assets and marketing strategies, and operate in different
geographical locations.  

91     

Barnwell
does not allocate general and administrative expenses, interest expense,
interest income or income taxes to segments, and there are no transactions
between segments that affect segment profit or loss. Other primarily relates to
gas processing.  

Depletion
per 1,000 cubic feet ( MCF ) of natural gas and natural gas equivalent ( MCFE ),
converted at a rate of one barrel of oil and natural gas liquids to 5.8 MCFE,
was $2.17 in fiscal 2006, $1.66 in fiscal 2005, and $1.31 in fiscal 2004.  The escalating depletion rate is the result
of increased costs of finding and developing proven reserves, as compared to
prior years, as well as increases in the  

92     

average exchange
rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar of 7% in fiscal 2006, as
compared to fiscal 2005, and 8% in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004.  

   ASSETS BY SEGMENT:   

(1)                   Primarily
located in the Province of Alberta, Canada. 

  (2)                   Located in Hawaii. 

   LONG-LIVED ASSETS BY
GEOGRAPHIC AREA:   

REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA:   

13.           FAIR
VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    

  The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit,
accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the
short maturity of these instruments.  The
carrying value of long-term debt approximates fair value as the terms
approximate current market terms for similar debt instruments of comparable
risk and maturities.  

  The
differences between the estimated fair values and carrying values of Barnwell s
financial instruments are not material.  

93     

14.           CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK    

  Barnwell s oil and natural gas segment derived
69% of its oil and natural gas revenues in fiscal 2006 from four individually
significant customers, ProGas Limited (30%), Glencoe Resources Ltd. (15%),
Plains Marketing Canada, L.P. (14%), and Seminole Canada Gas Company
(10%).  At September 30, 2006,
Barnwell had a total of $1,625,000 in receivables from these four customers.  In fiscal 2005 Barnwell derived 62% of its
oil and natural gas revenues from four individually significant customers.  In fiscal   2004
Barnwell derived 53% of its oil and natural gas revenues from three
individually significant customers.  

  Barnwell s
contract drilling subsidiary derived 37%, 63%, and 70% of its contract drilling
revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, pursuant to federal,
State of Hawaii and county contracts.  At
September 30, 2006, Barnwell had accounts receivables from the federal,
State of Hawaii and county entities totaling approximately $754,000.  Barnwell has lien rights on wells drilled and
pumps installed for federal, State of Hawaii, county and private entities.  

  Historically,
Barnwell has not incurred significant credit related losses on its trade
receivables, and management does not believe significant credit risk related to
these trade receivables exists at September 30, 2006.  

   15.           SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENTS OF CASH
FLOWS INFORMATION    

  The
following details the effect of changes in current assets and liabilities on
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and presents supplemental cash flow
information:  

94     

16.           SUBSEQUENT
EVENTS    

  In November 2006, Kaupulehu Investors, LLC, a
limited liability company wholly-owned by Barnwell, invested $3,000,000 in two
unrelated limited liability companies to acquire a passive minority interest in
Hualalai Resort, located at Kaupulehu, North Kona, Hawaii, which includes the
Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka     upulehu,
two golf courses and undeveloped residential property.  

  In December 2006, Barnwell declared a cash
dividend of $0.10 per share payable January 15, 2007, to stockholders of
record on December 28, 2006.

17.           SUMMARY OF SELECTED QUARTERLY
FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)    

  The following is a summary of unaudited quarterly results of operations
for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005:  

   Fiscal
2006:   

Fiscal 2005:   

(1)                   The quarterly results for fiscal year 2006 reflect
share-based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R) on a prospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal year
2006.  Accordingly, the quarterly results
for fiscal year 2005 do not reflect such expense. 

  (2)                   Due to the use of the weighted-average number
of shares of common shares outstanding for each quarter for computing earnings
per share, the sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal the per
share amount for the year. 

  (3)                   Prior to the end of the quarter ended
September 30, 2006, a holder of stock appreciation rights represented his
intention to exercise a portion of those rights in stock in the future.  Stock appreciation rights payments made in
cash are deductible for Canadian income tax purposes.  However, payments of stock appreciation
rights in shares of Barnwell s stock are not deductible for Canadian income tax
purposes, thus a deferred tax valuation allowance was recorded for the portion
of stock appreciation rights represented to be exercised in stock.  During the three months ended
September 30, 2006, the holder of these stock appreciation rights
exercised a portion of his stock appreciation rights in cash and subsequently
represented that he intends to exercise the remaining outstanding stock
appreciation rights in cash.  Accordingly,
Barnwell recorded an approximately $350,000 deferred tax benefit in the three
months ended September 30, 2006 related to the reduction of the valuation
allowance for stock appreciation rights for Canadian income tax purposes to
zero. 

96     

18.           SUPPLEMENTARY OIL AND NATURAL GAS
INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)    

  The
following tables summarize information relative to Barnwell s oil and natural
gas operations, which are substantially conducted in Canada.  Proved reserves are the estimated quantities
of crude oil, condensate and natural gas which geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.  Proved producing oil and natural gas reserves
are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with
existing equipment and operating methods. 
The estimated net interests in total proved and proved producing
reserves are based upon subjective engineering judgments and may be affected by
the limitations inherent in such estimations. 
The process of estimating reserves is subject to continual revision as
additional information becomes available as a result of drilling, testing,
reservoir studies and production history. 
There can be no assurance that such estimates will not be materially
revised in subsequent periods.  

  (A)           Oil and Natural Gas Reserves   

  The
following table, based on information prepared by independent petroleum
engineers, Paddock Lindstrom   Associates Ltd., summarizes changes in the
estimates of Barnwell s net interests in total proved reserves of crude oil and
natural gas liquids ( NGL ) and natural gas ( MCF  means 1,000 cubic feet of
natural gas) which are all in Canada:  

*                          These
amounts represent proved undeveloped reserves at Dunvegan added by Paddock
Lindstrom   Associates, Ltd. based on a drilling program that commenced and
was completed in fiscal 2005.  As of
September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2003, Paddock Lindstrom   Associates,
Ltd. reported no proved undeveloped reserves at Dunvegan. 

97     

(B)            Capitalized
Costs Relating to Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities   

(C)                                    Costs
Incurred in Oil and Natural Gas Property Acquisition, Exploration and
Development  

(D)                                   The
Results of Operations of Barnwell s Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities  

*                          Before
general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and foreign exchange
gains and losses. 

98     

(E)                                     Standardized
Measure, Including Year-to-Year Changes Therein, of Estimated Discounted Future
Net Cash Flows  

  The
following tables have been developed pursuant to procedures prescribed by SFAS
No. 69,  Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities - an amendment
of FASB Statements 19, 25, 33, and 39,  and utilize reserve and production data
estimated by petroleum engineers.  The
information may be useful for certain comparison purposes but should not be
solely relied upon in evaluating Barnwell or its performance.  Moreover, the projections should not be
construed as realistic estimates of future cash flows, nor should the
standardized measure be viewed as representing current value.  

  The
estimated future cash flows are based on sales prices, costs, and statutory
income tax rates in existence at the dates of the projections.  Material revisions to reserve estimates may
occur in the future, development and production of the oil and natural gas
reserves may not occur in the periods assumed and actual prices realized and
actual costs incurred are expected to vary significantly from those used.  Management does not rely upon this
information in making investment and operating decisions; rather, those
decisions are based upon a wide range of factors, including estimates of
probable reserves as well as proved reserves and price and cost assumptions
different than those reflected herein.  

   Standardized Measure of
Estimated Discounted Future Net Cash Flows   

99     

Changes in the
Standardized Measure of Estimated Discounted Future Net Cash Flows   

Based on a natural gas
spot price of $3.34 per 1,000 cubic feet ( MCF ) as of September 30, 2006,
the full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation by approximately
$1,581,000.  However, natural gas prices
increased significantly subsequent to September 30, 2006, but prior to the
filing of this annual report, such that Barnwell s full cost pool would not
have exceeded the ceiling limitation. 
The spot price of natural gas on December 18, 2006 was
approximately $6.30 per MCF, which represents an 89% increase over the September 30,
2006 spot price of $3.34 per MCF. 
Accordingly, per U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin Topic 12D, Barnwell has not recorded an impairment
write-down of its oil and natural gas properties at September 30, 2006.  

*                          $3,260,000
of this amount is derived from proved undeveloped reserves at Dunvegan added by
Paddock Lindstrom   Associates, Ltd. based on a planned drilling program
which commenced and was completed in fiscal 2005.  As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, Paddock
Lindstrom   Associates, Ltd. reported no proved undeveloped reserves at
Dunvegan.

  None.  

   ITEM 9A.                           CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

  As
of September 30, 2006, an evaluation was carried out by Barnwell s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of Barnwell s
disclosure controls and procedures. 
Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that Barnwell s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
Barnwell in reports that it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules
thereunder.  There was no change in
Barnwell s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended
September 30, 2006, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, Barnwell s internal control over financial reporting.

  In
June 1998, Barnwell granted 180,000 stock options to an officer of Barnwell s
oil and gas segment under a non-qualified plan at a purchase price of $2.60 per
share (market price on date of grant). 
These options are fully vested and have stock appreciation rights that
permit the holder to receive stock, cash or a combination thereof equal to the
amount by which the fair market value, at the time of exercise of the option,
exceeds the option price.  During the
year ended September 30, 2006, the officer exercised the stock
appreciation rights feature on 60,000 shares of these options.  The remaining 120,000 options expire in May
2008.  

  In
December 2004, Barnwell granted stock options to certain officers/directors of
Barnwell to acquire 210,000 shares of Barnwell s common stock under a
non-qualified plan at a purchase price of $8.80 per share (market price on date
of grant).  These options have stock
appreciation rights that permit the holders to receive stock, cash or a
combination thereof equal to the amount by which the fair market value, at the
time of exercise of the option, exceeds the option price.  These options vest annually over five years
commencing one year from the date of grant and expire in December 2014.  During the year ended September 30,
2006, an officer/director holding these options exercised the stock appreciation
rights feature on 30,000 shares of these options.

light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not

  3.                  Based on my
knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included

for, the periods presented in this report; 

  4.                  The registrant s
other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e))and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 

  a)                 Designed such
disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and

during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

  b)                Evaluated the

equivalent functions):  

  a)                 All significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information; and 

  b)                Any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
