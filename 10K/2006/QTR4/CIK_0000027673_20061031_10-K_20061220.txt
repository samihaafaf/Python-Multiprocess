PART I    

    Item 1  .   Business .  

   The Company   

  John Deere Capital Corporation
(Capital Corporation) and its subsidiaries are collectively called the
Company.  John Deere Credit Company, a
wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere   Company, owns all of the
outstanding common stock of the Capital Corporation. See  Relationships of the
Company with John Deere  for additional information regarding agreements
between the Company and Deere   Company. The Company conducts business in
Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., and in several countries in Europe and Latin
America.  

  The Company provides and administers financing for
retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by Deere   Company s
agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment, and construction and
forestry divisions and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. The
Company purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes)
from Deere   Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively called
John Deere). John Deere acquires these retail notes through John Deere retail
dealers. The Company also purchases and finances a limited amount of non-Deere
retail notes and continues to service a small portfolio of recreational
products and other retail notes. In addition, the Company leases John Deere
equipment and a limited amount of non-Deere equipment to retail customers
(financing and operating leases). The Company also finances and services
revolving charge accounts, in most cases   acquired from and offered
through merchants in the agricultural, commercial and consumer, and
construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Further, the
Company finances and services operating loans, in most cases offered through
and acquired from farm input providers or through direct relationships with
agricultural producers (operating loans). The Company also provides wholesale
financing for inventories of John Deere agricultural, commercial and consumer
and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those products (wholesale
receivables). The Company also offers credit enhanced international export
financing to select customers which generally involves John Deere products and
offers certain crop risk mitigation products in the U.S. In addition, the
Company invests in wind energy generation by making loans to certain affiliated
companies that have directly invested in wind energy projects. Retail notes,
revolving charge accounts, operating loans, financing leases and wholesale
receivables are collectively called  Receivables.  Receivables and operating
leases are collectively called  Receivables and Leases.     

  The Capital Corporation was incorporated under the
laws of Delaware and commenced operations in 1958. At November 30, 2006, the
Company had 1,476 full-time and part-time employees.  

   Business of John Deere   

  John Deere s operations are
categorized into four major business segments:  

  The  agricultural equipment  segment manufactures and distributes
a full line of farm equipment and related service parts   including tractors; combine,
cotton and sugarcane harvesters; tillage, seeding and soil preparation
machinery; sprayers; hay and forage equipment; integrated agricultural
management systems technology; and precision agricultural irrigation equipment.  

  The  commercial and consumer equipment  segment manufactures and
distributes equipment, products and service parts for commercial and
residential uses   including tractors for lawn, garden, commercial and utility
purposes; mowing equipment, including walk-behind mowers; golf course equipment;
utility vehicles; landscape products and irrigation equipment; and other
outdoor power products.  

  The  construction and forestry  segment manufactures, distributes
to dealers and sells at retail a broad range of machines and service parts used
in construction, earthmoving, material handling and timber harvesting  
including backhoe loaders; crawler dozers and loaders; four-wheel-drive
loaders; excavators; motor graders; articulated dump trucks; landscape loaders;
skid-steer loaders; and log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log
forwarders, log harvesters and related attachments.  

1     

John Deere s
worldwide agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment, and
construction and forestry operations are commonly referred to as the Equipment
Operations. The products and services produced by the segments above are
marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail
outlets.  

  The  credit operations  segment
includes the operations of the Company (described herein), John Deere
Credit Company, John Deere Credit Inc. (Canada), Banco John Deere, S.A.
(Brazil), John Deere Credit Oy (Finland) and John Deere Renewables, LLC, and
primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used
agricultural, commercial and consumer, and construction and forestry equipment.
In addition, it provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing
equipment, provides operating loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts,
offers certain crop risk mitigation products and invests in wind energy
generation.  

  John Deere had net income of $1,694 million, or $7.18
per share diluted ($7.26 per share basic), in 2006, compared with $1,447
million, or $5.87 per share diluted ($5.95 per share basic), in 2005. Income
from continuing operations, which excludes John Deere s discontinued health
care business, was $1,453 million, or $6.16 per share diluted ($6.23 basic) in
2006, compared to $1,414 million, or $5.74 per share diluted ($5.81 basic) last
year.  

  John Deere s net sales and revenues from continuing
operations increased 5 percent to $22,148 million in 2006, compared with
$21,191 million in 2005. Net sales of the Equipment Operations increased
2 percent in 2006 to $19,884 million from $19,401 million last year.
This included a positive effect for price changes of 3 percent. Equipment net
sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 3 percent in 2006. Net sales outside the
U.S. and Canada increased by 2 percent, which included a negative effect
of 1 percent for currency translation.  

  The agricultural equipment segment had net sales of
$10,232 million in 2006, compared to $10,567 million in 2005. The commercial
and consumer equipment segment had net sales of $3,877 million in 2006,
compared to $3,605 million in 2005. The construction and forestry segment
had net sales of $5,775 million in 2006, compared to $5,229 million in
2005. The credit operations segment had revenues of $1,819 million in 2006,
compared to $1,450 million in 2005.  

   Outlook for John Deere    

  John
Deere s equipment sales are projected to be roughly flat for the full year and
to increase approximately 5 percent for the first quarter of 2007,
compared to the same periods in 2006. Consistent with ongoing asset management
initiatives, production levels are expected to be down about 4 percent for both
the year and first quarter of 2007. Construction and forestry production in the
U.S. and Canada is expected to be down about 16 percent in the first
quarter. Based on the above, net income is forecast to be around $1.325 billion
for the year and in a range of $150 million to $175 million for the first
quarter.  

   Agricultural Equipment.     Worldwide farm economic conditions remain
quite promising. Demand for crops is benefiting from a global population that
is gaining in both size and affluence, and from a sharp rise in the use of
renewable fuels in the U.S. and other parts of the world. Prices for key farm
commodities have surged recently and worldwide carryover stocks for wheat and
corn are at 30-year lows in relation to consumption. Nevertheless, fiscal 2007
sales in the U.S. and Canada are expected to get off to a slow start as a
result of higher than desired used equipment inventories and customer
uncertainty regarding the direction of U.S. farm legislation. In addition,
farmers  concerns over the sustainability of the recent commodity price rally,
and with respect to input costs, are expected to weigh on 2007 sales. Based on
these factors, Deere   Company projects that industry retail sales in the
U.S. and Canada will be approximately flat for the year.  

  In
Western Europe, industry retail sales are forecast to be flat to down slightly
for the year due to the effect of a higher value-added tax in Germany and
further farm consolidation. Following the sharp downturn of the last two years,
industry retail sales in South America are expected to be down about 10 percent
for 2007. The forecast reduction is primarily related to uncertainty over
government sponsored financing programs in Brazil. Sales in Australia are
expected to be down by nearly 25 percent for the year, due in part to the
effect of serious drought on the nation s wheat crop.  

2     

Based on
these factors and market conditions, worldwide sales of John Deere agricultural
equipment are forecast to increase by about 4 percent for fiscal year 2007. First
quarter sales are expected to rise about 10 percent, being driven by new
products in Europe and by a late calendar year 2006 sales pickup in Germany,
expected in advance of the value-added tax hike on January 1. Farm machinery
production in the U.S. and Canada is expected to be down approximately 8
percent for the first quarter in comparison with the same period a year ago.  

   Commercial and Consumer Equipment  .  Sales of John Deere commercial and consumer
equipment are forecast to be up about 4 percent for the year. Growth in the
landscapes operations and the successful introduction of new products are
expected to more than offset the impact of a softer market for residential
housing. 

   Construction and Forestry.    Markets for construction and forestry
equipment are expected to see a slowdown in 2007. While nonresidential spending
is forecast for further improvement, residential housing construction is
expected to be lower. In this environment, John Deere s worldwide sales of
construction and forestry equipment are forecast to decrease by about 5 percent
for fiscal 2007. 

   Credit Operations  .  Fiscal year 2007 net income for the credit operations is forecast to be
approximately $345 million. The expected improvement is being
driven by growth in the credit portfolio, largely offset by higher selling and
administrative expenses in support of the segment s growth initiatives. The
Company s net income for 2007, which does not include the credit operations in
Canada, Brazil and Finland or the wind energy operations in the U.S., is
projected to be approximately $295 million for 2007. 

   Relationships of the Company with John Deere   

  The results of operations of the Company are affected
by its relationships with John Deere, including among other items, the terms on
which the Company acquires Receivables and Leases and borrows funds from John
Deere, the reimbursement for interest waiver and low-rate finance programs from
John Deere, the compensation paid by John Deere in connection with the Company s
purchase of trade receivables from John Deere and the payment to John Deere for
various expenses applicable to the Company s operations. The Company also has
loans to John Deere for direct investments in wind energy projects. In
addition, the Company and John Deere have joint access to certain lines of
credit of the Company.  

  The Company s acquisition volume of Receivables and
Leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of John
Deere products. The level of John Deere retail sales and leases is responsive
to a variety of economic, financial, climatic, legislative and other factors
that influence demand for its products. All of the Company s businesses are
affected by changes in interest rates, demand for credit and competition.  

  The Company bears substantially all of the credit risk
(net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers, and Farm
Plan     and PowerPlan   
merchants) associated with its holding of Receivables and Leases. A small
portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) is guaranteed
by certain subsidiaries of Deere   Company. The Company also performs
substantially all servicing and collection functions. Servicing and collection
functions for a small portion of the Receivables and Leases held (less than 5
percent) are provided by John Deere. John Deere is reimbursed for staff and
other administrative services at estimated cost, and for credit lines provided
to the Company based on utilization of those lines. 

  The terms and the basis on which the Company acquires
retail notes and certain wholesale receivables from John Deere are governed by
agreements with John Deere, generally terminable by either John Deere or the
Company on 30 days notice. As provided in these agreements, the Company agrees
to the terms and conditions for purchasing the retail notes and wholesale
receivables from John Deere. Under these agreements, John Deere is not
obligated to sell notes to the Company, and the Company is obligated to
purchase notes from John Deere only if the notes comply with the terms and
conditions set by the Company.  

  The basis on which John Deere acquires retail notes
and wholesale receivables from the dealers is governed by agreements with the
John Deere dealers, terminable at will by either the dealers or John Deere. In
acquiring these notes  

3     

from dealers, the terms and conditions, as set forth in agreements with
the dealers, conform with the terms and conditions adopted by the Company in
determining the acceptability of retail and certain wholesale notes to be
purchased from John Deere. The dealers are not obligated to sell these notes to
John Deere and John Deere is not obligated to accept these notes from the
dealers. In practice, retail and wholesale notes are acquired from dealers only
if the terms of these notes and the creditworthiness of the customers are
acceptable to the Company. The Company acts on behalf of both itself and John
Deere in determining the acceptability of the notes and in acquiring acceptable
notes from dealers.  

  The basis on which the Company enters into leases with
retail customers through John Deere dealers is governed by agreements between
dealers and the Company. Leases are accepted based on the terms and conditions,
the lessees  creditworthiness, the anticipated residual values of the equipment
and the intended uses of the equipment.  

  Deere   Company has an agreement with the Company
pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own at least 51 percent of the
voting shares of capital stock of the Company and to maintain the Company s
consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. This agreement
also obligates Deere   Company to make income maintenance payments to the
Company such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not
less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter. For 2006 and 2005, the Company s
ratios were 1.60 to 1 and 1.88 to 1, respectively, and never less than 1.53 to
1 and 1.74 to 1 for any fiscal quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Deere   Company s obligations to make payments to the Company
under the agreement are independent of whether the Company is in default on its
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere   Company s
obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of the Company s
indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Deere   Company s
obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to
be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation or liability of the
Company and are enforceable only by or in the name of the Company. No payments
were required under this agreement during the periods included in the financial
statements.  

  The Company purchases certain wholesale receivables
(trade receivables) from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John
Deere s sales of goods to dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers,
interest is charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the
date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of
certain interest-free periods granted to the dealer at the time of the sale,
until payment is received by the Company. 
Dealers cannot cancel purchases after goods are shipped and are
responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers.
The interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold
and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months
for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged
may not be forgiven and interest rates, which exceed the prime rate, are set
based on market factors. The Company receives compensation from John Deere
equal to competitive market interest rates for these interest-free periods. The
Company computes the compensation from John Deere for interest-free periods
based on the Company s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating
expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. The finance income
earned following the interest-free period is not significantly different from
the compensation earned from John Deere.  

   Description of
Receivables and Leases   

  Receivables and Leases arise mainly from retail and
wholesale sales and leases of John Deere products and used equipment accepted
in trade for them, and from retail sales of equipment of unrelated
manufacturers. Receivables and Leases also include revolving charge accounts
receivable and operating loans. At October 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately
90 percent of the Receivables and Leases administered by the Company were
for financing John Deere products.  

  FPC Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, holds a federal charter issued by the
Office of Thrift Supervision. The Thrift is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin
and offers revolving charge products such as John Deere Credit Revolving Plan,
Farm Plan      and PowerPlan      on a nationwide basis. John Deere
Credit Revolving Plan is used primarily by retail customers of John Deere
dealers to finance purchases of commercial and consumer equipment. Through its
Farm Plan      product, the Thrift
finances revolving charge accounts offered by approximately 5,000 participating
agri-businesses to their retail customers for the purchase of goods and
services. Farm Plan      account holders purchase equipment parts and service at
implement dealerships and farm inputs such as feed,  

4     

seed, fertilizer, bulk fuel and building supplies
from other agribusinesses. The PowerPlan      revolving charge account is used by construction and
forestry customers to finance the purchase of parts and service work performed
at John Deere construction and forestry dealers. See Note 2 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements under  Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable.   

  The Company also works with several leading farm input
providers to offer crop input production loans for materials such as seeds and
fertilizer. Additionally, the Company provides production loans directly to
farmers for their total operating needs. Generally, these loans are secured by
crops and equipment.  

  The Company finances wholesale inventories of John
Deere agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment and
construction and forestry equipment. A large portion of the wholesale financing
provided by the Company is with dealers from whom it also purchases
agricultural, commercial and consumer and construction and forestry retail
notes. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under  Wholesale
Receivables.   

  The Company requires that theft and physical damage
insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes. The
customers may, at their expense, have the Company or the seller of the goods
purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources. Theft and physical
damage insurance is also required on goods securing wholesale notes and can be
purchased through the Company or from other sources. Insurance is not required
for goods purchased under revolving charge accounts.  

  Receivables and Leases are eligible for acceptance if
they conform to prescribed finance and lease plan terms. Guidelines relating to
down payments and contract terms on retail notes and leases are described in
Note 2 and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  In limited circumstances, Receivables and Leases may
be accepted and acquired even though they do not conform in all respects to the
established guidelines. The Company determines whether Receivables and Leases
should be accepted and how they should be serviced. Acceptance of these
Receivables and Leases is dependent on having one or more of the following risk
mitigation enhancements: the pledge of additional collateral as security, the
assignment of specific earnings to the Company or the acceptance of accelerated
payment schedules. Officers of the Company are responsible for establishing
policies and reviewing the performance of the Company in accepting and collecting
Receivables and Leases. The Company normally makes all of its own routine
collections, settlements and repossessions on Receivables and Leases.  

  John Deere retail notes and
wholesale receivables are supported by perfected security interests in goods
financed under laws such as the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), certain federal
statutes and state motor vehicle laws. UCC financing statements are also
prepared and filed on leases; however, filings for operating leases are made
for informational purposes only.  

   Finance Rates on Retail Notes   

  As of October 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 85
percent and 75 percent, respectively, of the retail notes held by the Company
bore a fixed finance rate. A portion of the finance income earned by the
Company arises from reimbursements from John Deere in connection with financing
the retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance charges are waived or
reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale to a specified
subsequent date. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information.  

5     

Average Original Term and
Average Actual Life of Retail Notes and Leases   

  Due to prepayments (often from trade-ins and
refinancing), the average actual life of retail notes and financing leases is
considerably shorter than the average original term. The following table shows
the average original term for retail notes and leases acquired and the average
actual life for retail notes and leases liquidated (in months):

portfolio.  The level of the allowance is
based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss
experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends,
economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company has an established
process to calculate a range of possible outcomes and determine the adequacy of
the allowance. No single statistic or measurement determines the adequacy of
the allowance. Historical receivable recoveries and charge-offs are considered
as part of the loss experience by product category.  The adequacy of the allowance is assessed
quarterly in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and FASB Statement No. 114,
Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan. Different assumptions or
changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for
credit losses and provision for credit losses.  

  The allowance is
determined at an aggregate level by product category for all Receivables that
are performing in accordance with payment terms and are not materially past
due. The Company assigns loss factors to each aggregation and loss factors are
applied to the applicable Receivable balance to determine the allowance level
for each product category. The loss factors are determined based on
quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience by
product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends, economic conditions
and credit risk quality.  

  The
Company also separately reviews non-performing Receivables for impairment based
on delinquencies and changes in cash flows or collateral. These non-performing
Receivables consist of materially past due Receivables, customers that have
provided bankruptcy notification and other Receivables requiring significant
collection efforts including litigation. The Company identifies these
Receivables during reviews of portfolio credit quality. The Company includes
the impairment on non-performing Receivables as a separate component included
in the allowance unless it has already been recognized as a loss.  

  In
addition to the calculations discussed above, other qualitative factors are
taken into account to arrive at the allowance balance. The total allowance
reflects management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the Receivables
portfolio at the balance sheet date. See further discussion of the allowance
for credit losses in the Critical Accounting Policies.  

   Competition   

  The businesses in which the Company is engaged are
highly competitive. The Company competes for customers with commercial banks
and finance and leasing companies based upon its service, finance rates charged
and other finance terms. The proportion of John Deere equipment retail sales
and leases financed by the Company is influenced by conditions prevailing in
the agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer equipment, and construction
and forestry equipment industries, in the financial markets, and in business
generally. The Company financed a significant portion of John Deere equipment
retail sales and leases in the U.S. during 2006 and 2005.  

  The Company emphasizes convenient service to customers
and endeavors to offer terms desired in its specialized markets such as
seasonal schedules of repayment and rentals. The Company s retail note finance
rates and lease rental rates are generally believed to be in the range offered
by other sales finance and leasing companies, although not as low as those of
some banks and other lenders and lessors.  

10  

Regulation   

  In a number of states, state law limits the maximum
finance rate on receivables. The present state limitations have not, thus far,
significantly limited variable-rate finance charges or the fixed-rate finance
charges established by the Company. However, if interest rate levels should
increase significantly, maximum state rates could affect the Company by
preventing the variable rates on outstanding variable-rate retail notes from
increasing above the maximum state rate, and by limiting the fixed rates on new
notes. In some states, the Company may be able to qualify new retail notes for
a higher maximum rate limit by using retail installment sales contracts (rather
than loan contracts) or by using fixed-rate rather than variable-rate
contracts.  

  In addition to rate regulation, various state and
federal laws and regulations apply to some Receivables and Leases, principally
retail notes for goods sold for personal, family or household use and Farm Plan    ,
PowerPlan    and John Deere Credit Revolving Plan accounts
receivable for such goods. To date, these laws and regulations have not had a
significant adverse effect on the Company. 

  FPC Financial, f.s.b. (Thrift), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company, holds a federal charter issued by the Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and is subject to federal regulation and examination by the
OTS. The Thrift is headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin and offers revolving
charge products such as John Deere Credit Revolving Plan, Farm Plan    
and PowerPlan    on a nationwide basis. 

  Financing outside the U.S. is affected by a variety of
laws, customs and regulations.  

    Item 1A  .   Risk Factors .  

  The Company is a wholly-owned finance holding
subsidiary of Deere   Company. The results of operations of the Company are
affected by its relationships with Deere   Company. See  Relationships of
the Company with John Deere  on page 3 for additional information regarding the
relationship between the Company and Deere   Company.  

   Economic
Condition and Outlook.    General economic conditions can affect the
demand for John Deere s equipment. Negative economic conditions or a negative
outlook, for example, can decrease housing starts and other construction and
dampen demand for equipment. Strength or weakness in the overall farm economy
can have a similar effect on Deere   Company s agricultural equipment
sales. 

   Consumer
Attitudes.    The confidence John Deere s customers have in
the general economic outlook can have a significant effect on their propensity
to purchase equipment and, consequently, on Deere   Company s sales. John
Deere s ability to match its new product offerings to its customers 
anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment is important
as well. 

   Interest
Rates and Credit Ratings.    If interest rates rise, they
could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and could affect the
demand for John Deere s equipment. In addition, funding costs are very
important to the Company. Decisions and actions by credit rating agencies can
affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company.  Credit rating downgrades or negative changes
to ratings outlooks can increase the Company s cost of capital and hurt its
competitive position. 

  The
risks identified above should be considered in conjunction with  Management s
Discussion and Analysis  beginning on page 12, and, specifically, the other
risks described in the  Safe Harbor Statement  on page 20. The Company s
results of operations may be affected by these identified risks and/or by risks
not currently contemplated.

    Item 3  .   Legal Proceedings .  

  The Company is subject to various unresolved legal
actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of
which relate to state and federal laws and regulations concerning retail
credit. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of
these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company
believes these unresolved legal actions will not have a material effect on its
financial statements.

   Overview   

   Organization   

  The Company primarily generates revenues and cash by
financing sales and leases of new and used agricultural, commercial and
consumer, and construction and forestry equipment by John Deere dealers.  In addition, the Company also provides
wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, provides operating
loans, finances retail revolving charge accounts, offers certain crop risk
mitigation products and invests in wind energy generation.

Trends and Economic Conditions   

  The Company s business is currently affected by the
following key trends and economic conditions. The Company s business is closely
related to John Deere s business. Worldwide farm economic conditions remain
promising as demand for crops is benefiting from a global population that is
gaining in both size and affluence, and a sharp rise in the use of renewable
fuels. However, fiscal 2007 Deere   Company sales in the U.S. and Canada
are expected to have a slow start as a result of the level of used equipment
inventories and customer uncertainty regarding the direction of U.S. farm
legislation. Industry retail sales of agricultural equipment in the U.S. and
Canada in 2007 are expected to be approximately flat for the year, while sales
in Western Europe are forecast to be flat to down slightly. In South America
and Australia, the outlook for industry retail sales for 2007 is expected to be
down about 10 percent and nearly 25 percent, respectively. Deere   Company s
agricultural equipment net sales were down 3 percent for 2006 and are forecast
to be up approximately 4 percent in 2007. Deere   Company s commercial and
consumer equipment net sales were up 8 percent in 2006. These sales are
forecast to be up about 4 percent in 2007, reflecting the impact of higher
sales from the landscapes operations and the introduction of new products.
Markets for construction and forestry equipment are expected to see a slowdown
in 2007. Deere   Company s construction and forestry net sales increased 10
percent in 2006 and are forecast to decrease about 5 percent in 2007. The
Company expects to report net income of approximately $295 million in 2007 as a result of further growth in the loan
portfolio, largely offset by higher administrative and operating expenses in
support of the Company s growth initiatives.  

   2006 Compared with 2005   

  Consolidated
net income was $291.2 million for the year, compared with $274.7 million last
year. The higher results for the year were primarily due to growth in the
portfolio, partially offset by narrower financing spreads and a higher
provision for credit losses. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.60 to
1 for 2006, compared with 1.88 to 1 for 2005.  

  Revenues totaled $1,705 million in 2006, compared to
$1,377 million a year ago. Revenues increased primarily due to a 14 percent
increase in the average balance of Receivables and Leases financed and higher
financing rates. Finance income earned on retail notes totaled $713 million in
2006, up $191 million compared to  $522 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to a
23 percent increase in the average retail note portfolio balances and
increasing yields. Lease revenues increased $30 million to $286 million in
2006, primarily due to a 10 percent increase in the average balance of
equipment on operating leases. Revenues earned on revolving charge accounts
amounted to $210 million in 2006, a 9 percent increase over revenues
of $193 million earned during 2005. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in Farm Plan    and PowerPlan   
average receivables in 2006 and higher financing rates, compared with 2005.
Finance income earned on wholesale receivables increased $64 million, to
$355 million in 2006, from $291 million in 2005. The increase was
primarily due to increasing yields and a 3 percent increase in the average
balance of wholesale receivables. Revenues earned on operating loans amounted
to $27 million in 2006, compared with $24 million in 2005. Revenues earned
from Deere   Company totaled $468 million in 2006 compared to
$401 million a year ago. 

  The net loss on Receivables sold, including adjustments
to prior sales related to cleanup calls and revaluations of retained interests
and the related permanent impairments, totaled $1 million during 2006, compared
with a net gain of $5 million for 2005. Securitization and servicing fee
income totaled $30 million in 2006, compared with $40 million during
2005. Securitization and servicing fee income relates to Receivables sold to
other financial institutions or limited-purpose business trusts and primarily
includes the interest earned on retained interests and reimbursed
administrative expenses received.  

  Crop
insurance commissions totaled $35 million in 2006, compared with $8 million in
2005. The increase was primarily due to increased crop insurance sales to
producers as a result of expanded market coverage. At October 31, 2006, the
Company was offering crop insurance products in 30 states compared to 17 states
a year ago.  

13     

Interest
expense totaled $727 million in 2006, compared with $473 million in 2005. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in the weighted-average annual
interest rate incurred on all borrowings from 3.9 percent in 2005 to
5.0 percent in 2006 and higher average borrowings.  

  Administrative
and operating expenses totaled $274 million in 2006, compared with $251 million
in 2005. The increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with
administering a larger Receivable and Lease portfolio and higher costs in
support of the Company s growth initiatives.  

  Depreciation
of equipment on operating leases totaled $190 million in 2006, compared with
$169 million in 2005 .
The increase was primarily the result of higher average amounts of equipment on
operating leases. 

  Interest
and support fees paid to John Deere were $42 million in 2006, compared with
$53 million in 2005. The decrease was primarily due to lower average
borrowings from Deere   Company.  

  The
provision for credit losses was $31 million in 2006, compared with $6 million
in 2005. The Company has experienced higher write-offs of retail notes,
revolving charge accounts, operating loans and financing leases. The provision
for credit losses, as a percentage of the total average balance of Receivables
financed, was .19 percent for 2006 and .04 percent for 2005. Total net
write-offs of Receivables financed were $34 million during 2006, compared with
$22 million in 2005.  

   Receivables and Leases Acquired and Held   

  Receivables and Leases acquired by the Company during
2006 totaled $29,557 million, an increase of 2 percent, compared with
volumes of $29,088 million during 2005. These higher volumes in 2006 resulted
mainly from increased volumes of wholesale receivables, operating loans,
revolving charge accounts and equipment on operating leases. Excluding the
trade receivables acquired from John Deere, acquisitions of Receivables and
Leases were 6 percent higher in 2006 compared to last year. Receivables
and Leases held by the Company at October 31, 2006 totaled $17,669 million,
compared with $16,002 million at October 31, 2005. For the 2006 and 2005
fiscal years, Receivable and Lease acquisition volumes and balances held were
as follows (in millions of dollars):  

Retail note volumes increased by approximately $34 million
in 2006, compared with 2005. Lease volumes increased $81 million in 2006,
compared with 2005. The increases in retail note and lease volumes were
primarily due to increases in retail sales of John Deere construction and
forestry equipment. Revolving charge account volumes increased primarily as a
result of increased market coverage. Wholesale receivable volumes increased
primarily due to increased shipments of John Deere equipment as a result of
increased retail sales activity in the construction and forestry markets.  

14     

Receivables and Leases administered by the Company,
which include retail notes sold, were as follows (in millions):  

*                                           The Company s maximum
exposure under all Receivable and Lease recourse provisions at October 31, 2006
and 2005 was $105 million and $140 million, respectively. In addition, the
Company has provided letters of credit for John Deere Credit Inc., the John
Deere finance subsidiary in Canada, as part of retail note sales. At
October 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company s maximum exposure under these
agreements was approximately $7 million. The Company does not record the
recourse obligations as liabilities as they are contingent liabilities that are
remote at this time. However, the probable loss on receivables that have been
sold was accrued at the time of sale, and any subsequent necessary adjustments
are made as part of ongoing reviews.  

  **                                    These receivables represent retail notes
that the Company has sold but continues to administer for a fee.  

  Retail notes bearing fixed finance rates totaled 85
percent of the total retail note portfolio at October 31, 2006,
compared with 75 percent at October 31, 2005.  

  Total
Receivable amounts 60 days or more past due represent the amount of all
customer payments past due 60 days or more. These amounts were $43 million
at October 31, 2006, compared with $33 million at October 31, 2005.
In addition, these past due amounts represented .26 percent and .21 percent of
the total Receivables held at those respective dates. The balance of retail
notes held (principal plus accrued interest) with any installment 60 days or
more past due represents the total retail note balance for a customer that has
any portion of his note 60 days or more past due. These amounts were $116
million and $78 million at October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The balances of retail notes held on which any installment was 60 days or more
past due as a percentage of the ending retail notes receivable was
1.08 percent at October 31, 2006 and .84 percent at October
31, 2005. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
past due information.  

  Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants,
representing mainly the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding
accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and
leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged, amounted to $177
million at October 31, 2006, compared to $166 million at October 31, 2005. The
Company s allowance for credit losses on all Receivables financed at October
31, 2006 totaled $93 million and represented .55 percent of the total
Receivables financed, compared with $96 million and .63 percent,
respectively, one year earlier. The allowance is subject to an ongoing
evaluation based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including
historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency
trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company believes its
allowance is sufficient to provide for losses in its existing receivable
portfolio.  

   2005 Compared with 2004   

  Consolidated
net income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 was $274.7 million,
compared with $270.6 million in 2004. The higher results for 2005 were
primarily due to growth in the portfolio and a lower provision for credit
losses, partially offset by narrower financing spreads and lower gains on
retail note sales. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.88 to 1 for
2005, compared with 2.23 to 1 for 2004.  

15     

Revenues
totaled $1,377 million in 2005, compared to $1,219 million in 2004. Revenues
increased primarily due to a 19 percent increase in the average balance of
Receivables and Leases financed, partially offset by lower gains on receivable
sales. Finance income earned on retail notes totaled $522 million in 2005, up
$138 million compared to  $384 million
in 2004. The increase was primarily due to a 30 percent increase in the average
retail note portfolio balances and increasing yields. Lease revenues decreased
$7 million to $256 million in 2005, primarily due to a 3 percent
decrease in the average balance of equipment on operating leases. Revenues
earned on revolving charge accounts amounted to $193 million in 2005, a
14 percent increase over revenues of $169 million earned during 2004. The
increase was primarily due to growth of Farm Plan   
and John Deere Credit Revolving Plan average receivables in 2005, compared with
2004. Finance income earned on wholesale receivables increased
$46 million, to $291 million in 2005, from $245 million in 2004.
The increase was primarily due to a 15 percent increase in the average balance
of wholesale receivables. Revenues earned on operating loans amounted to $24
million in 2005, compared with $23 million in 2004. Revenues earned from
Deere   Company totaled $401 million in 2005 compared to $365 million
in 2004. 

  The net gains on Receivables sold, including
adjustments to prior sales related to cleanup calls and revaluations of
retained interests and the related permanent impairments, totaled $5 million
during 2005, compared with $46 million for 2004. During 2004, the Company
benefited from the sale of agricultural and construction and forestry retail
notes of approximately $2,156 million total principal value. Securitization and
servicing fee income totaled $40 million in 2005, compared with $51 million
during 2004. Securitization and servicing fee income relates to Receivables
sold to other financial institutions or limited-purpose business trusts and
primarily includes the interest earned on retained interests and reimbursed
administrative expenses received.  

  Interest
expense totaled $473 million in 2005, compared with $327 million in 2004. The
increase was primarily due to higher average borrowings and an increase in the
weighted-average annual interest rate incurred on all borrowings from 3.1
percent in 2004 to 3.9 percent in 2005.  

  Administrative
and operating expenses totaled $251 million in 2005, compared with $245 million
in 2004. Administrative and operating expenses as a percent of average
Receivables and Leases administered were 1.48 percent in 2005, compared with
1.61 percent in 2004.  

  Depreciation
of equipment on operating leases totaled $169 million in 2005, compared with
$170 million in 2004 . 

  Interest
and support fees paid to John Deere were $53 million in 2005, compared with
$34 million in 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher average
borrowings from Deere   Company and an increase in the weighted-average
annual interest rate in 2005.  

  The
provision for credit losses was $6 million in 2005, compared with $32 million
in 2004. The decrease reflects solid portfolio quality. The Company has
experienced lower write-offs of retail notes, operating loans, wholesale
receivables and financing leases. The provision for credit losses, as a
percentage of the total average balance of Receivables financed, was .04
percent for 2005 and .28 percent for 2004. Total net write-offs of Receivables
financed were $22 million during 2005, compared with $34 million in 2004.  

16     

Receivables
and Leases Acquired and Held   

  Receivables and Leases acquired by the Company during
2005 totaled $29,088 million, an increase of 10 percent, compared with
volumes of $26,443 million during 2004. These higher volumes in 2005 resulted
mainly from increased volumes of wholesale receivables, retail notes, and
revolving charge accounts. Excluding the trade receivables acquired from John
Deere, acquisitions of Receivables and Leases were 7 percent higher in 2005
compared to 2004. Receivables and Leases held by the Company at October 31,
2005 totaled $16,002 million, compared with $13,342 million at October 31,
2004. For the 2005 and 2004 fiscal years, Receivable and Lease acquisition
volumes and balances held were as follows (in millions of dollars):  

Retail note volumes increased by approximately $378
million in 2005, compared with 2004. Lease volumes increased $99 million in
2005, compared with 2004. The increases in retail note and lease volumes were
primarily due to increases in retail sales of John Deere agricultural and
construction and forestry equipment. Revolving charge accounts volumes
increased primarily as a result of increased market coverage. Wholesale
receivable volumes increased primarily due to increased shipments of John Deere
equipment as a result of increased retail sales activity in the agricultural
and construction and forestry markets.  

  The
balance of retail notes at October 31, 2005 and 2004 was $9,234 million and
$6,874 million, respectively. The increase was due to retail note volumes
exceeding collections and a change in structure of new securitizations of
retail notes. Beginning in 2005, the Company s new securitizations of retail
notes held by special purpose entities met the criteria for secured borrowings
rather than sales of receivables under FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities.
As a result, these securitized retail notes are classified as  Restricted
securitized retail notes  on the balance sheet. See Note 4 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.  

  Receivables
and Leases administered by the Company, which include retail notes sold, were
as follows (in millions):  

17     

*                                          The
Company s maximum exposure under all Receivable and Lease recourse provisions
at October 31, 2005 and 2004 was $140 million and $203 million, respectively.
In addition, the Company has provided letters of credit for John Deere Credit
Inc., the John Deere finance subsidiary in Canada, as part of retail note
sales. At October 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company s maximum exposure
under these agreements was approximately $7 million and $8 million,
respectively. The Company does not record the recourse obligations as
liabilities as they are contingent liabilities that are remote at this time.
However, the probable loss on receivables that have been sold was accrued at
the time of sale, and any subsequent necessary adjustments are made as part of
ongoing reviews. 

  **                                    These receivables represent retail notes
that the Company has sold but continues to administer for a fee.  

  Retail notes bearing fixed finance rates totaled 75
percent of the total retail note portfolio at October 31, 2005,
compared with 80 percent at October 31, 2004.  

  Total
Receivable amounts 60 days or more past due represent the amount of all
customer payments past due 60 days or more. These amounts were $33 million
at October 31, 2005, compared with $40 million at October 31, 2004.
In addition, these past due amounts represented .21 percent and .32 percent of
the total Receivables held at those respective dates. The balance of retail
notes held (principal plus accrued interest) with any installment 60 days or
more past due represents the total retail note balance for a customer that has
any portion of his note 60 days or more past due. These amounts were $78
million and $71 million at October 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The balances of retail notes held on which any installment was 60
days or more past due as a percentage of the ending retail notes receivable was
..84 percent at October 31, 2005 and 1.03 percent at October
31, 2004. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
past due information.  

  Deposits withheld from dealers and merchants,
representing mainly the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding
accounts from individual John Deere dealers to which losses from retail notes
and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged, amounted to
$166 million at October 31, 2005, compared to $168 million at October 31, 2004.
The Company s allowance for credit losses on all Receivables financed at
October 31, 2005 totaled $96 million and represented .63 percent of the total
Receivables financed, compared with $113 million and .89 percent,
respectively, at October 31, 2004. The allowance is subject to an ongoing
evaluation based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including
historical loss experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency
trends, economic conditions and credit risk quality. The Company believes its
allowance is sufficient to provide for losses in its existing receivable
portfolio.  

   Capital Resources and Liquidity   

  The
aggregate cash provided by operating and financing activities was used
primarily to increase Receivables and Leases. Cash provided by operating
activities was $481 million in 2006. Cash provided by financing activities
totaled $1,464 million resulting from a net increase in external
borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in payables to Deere   Company
and dividends paid to John Deere Credit Company, which in turn paid comparable
dividends to Deere   Company. Cash used for investing activities totaled
$2,078 million in 2006, primarily due to the cost of Receivables and Leases
acquired exceeding collections. Cash and cash equivalents decreased
$131 million during 2006.  

  Over the last three years, operating activities have
provided $1,348 million in cash. In addition, the sale of Receivables and
Leases provided $3,227 million and an increase in total net borrowings provided
$5,171 million. These amounts have been used mainly to fund Receivable and
Lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections by $9,212 million, and to
pay $655 million in dividends.  

  The
financing of retail purchases and leases of John Deere products and of wholesale
receivables due from John Deere dealers represented approximately 85 percent of
the Company s acquisition volume for 2006 and 2005. Any extended reduction or
suspension of John Deere s sale or production of products due to a decline in
demand or production, governmental actions or other events could have an
adverse effect on the Company s acquisition volume of Receivables and Leases.  

18     

The Company relies on its ability to raise substantial
amounts of funds to finance its Receivable and Lease portfolios. Because of the
multiple funding sources that have been and continue to be available to the
Company, the Company expects to have sufficient sources of liquidity to meet
its ongoing funding needs. The Company s ability to meet its debt obligations
is supported in a number of ways. The assets of the Company are
self-liquidating in nature. A strong equity position is available to absorb
unusual losses on these assets and all commercial paper is backed by unsecured,
committed borrowing lines from various banks. Liquidity is also provided by the
Company s ability to securitize these assets.  

  During 2006, the Company issued $2,670 million of
medium-term notes, obtained $1,668 million of secured borrowings, maintained an
average commercial paper balance of $1,936 million and received proceeds of
$143 million from sales of Receivables. At October 31, 2006, the
Company s funding profile included $2,290 million of commercial paper,
$2,194 million of notes payable related to on-balance sheet securitization
funding, $178 million of intercompany loans from Deere   Company,
$10,880 million of unsecured term debt, $842 million of off-balance sheet
securitization funding and $2,154 million of equity capital. The Company s
funding profile may be altered to reflect such factors as relative costs of
funding sources, assets available for securitizations and capital market
accessibility.  

  The Company s commercial paper outstanding at October
31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $2,290 million and
$1,696 million, respectively, while the total cash and cash equivalents
position was $119 million and $250 million, respectively.  

  The Company issued $2,670 million and retired
$2,443 million of other borrowings during the year, which were primarily
medium-term notes.  

  The Company utilizes a revolving
multi-bank conduit facility to securitize floating rate retail notes (see
Note 4). This facility has the capacity, or  purchase limit,  of up to
$1.75 billion in secured financings or sales outstanding at any time. This
facility has no final maturity date. Instead, upon the Company s request, each
conduit may elect to renew its commitment on an annual basis. If this facility
is not renewed, the Company would liquidate the securitizations as the payments
on these retail notes are collected. At October 31, 2006, $1,575 million was
outstanding under the facility of which $1,036 million was recorded on the
balance sheet. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

  Total interest-bearing indebtedness amounted to
$15,555 million at October 31, 2006, compared with $13,958 million at
October 31, 2005. Included in this debt are secured borrowings of $2,194
million and $1,353 million for the same periods. Total external borrowings have
increased generally corresponding with the level of the Receivable and Lease
portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents and the change in payable to
Deere   Company. Total short-term indebtedness amounted to $7,143 million
at October 31, 2006, which included $2,194 million of secured borrowings,
compared with $5,767 million at October 31, 2005, which included $1,353 million
of secured borrowings, while total long-term indebtedness amounted to $8,413
million at October 31, 2006 and $8,191 million at October 31, 2005.
The ratio of total interest-bearing debt to stockholder s equity was 7.2 to 1
both at October 31, 2006 and at 2005.  

  Stockholder s
equity was $2,154 million at October 31, 2006, compared with $1,940 million and
$1,807 million at October 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  The increase in 2006 was primarily due to net
income of $291 million and an increase in the cumulative translation adjustment
of $10 million, partially offset by dividend payments of $85 million.  

  The Capital Corporation declared and paid cash
dividends to John Deere Credit Company of $85 million in 2006 and $150 million
in 2005. In each case, John Deere Credit Company paid comparable dividends to
Deere   Company.  

19     

Lines of Credit   

  The Company also has access to bank lines of credit
with various banks throughout the world. Some of the lines are available to
both the Company and Deere   Company. Worldwide lines of credit totaled
$3,016 million at October 31, 2006, $410 million of which was unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines,
commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings
and the current portion of long-term borrowings, of the Company and John Deere
were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines
at October 31, 2006 was a long-term credit facility agreement of $3 billion,
expiring in February 2011.  The credit agreement requires the Company to maintain its consolidated
ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal
quarter and its ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to
capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder s equity excluding
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 8.5 to 1
at the end of any fiscal quarter. All of these requirements of the credit
agreement have been met during the periods included in the financial
statements. For information regarding Deere   Company and its
business, see Business of John Deere, Outlook for John Deere, Relationships of
the Company with John Deere above and Exhibit 99. 

   Debt Ratings   

  The Company s ability to obtain funding is affected by
its debt ratings, which are closely related to the outlook for and the
financial condition of Deere   Company, and the nature and availability of
support facilities, such as its lines of credit and the support agreement from
Deere   Company.  

  To access public debt capital markets, the Company
relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit
ratings to the Company s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed
income investors. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw Company ratings
based on its assessment of the Company s current and future ability to meet
interest and principal repayment obligations. Lower credit ratings generally
result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets.  

  The
senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to
unsecured Company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the Company are
the same as those for Deere   Company. Those ratings are as follows:  

Senior Long-Term

Safe Harbor
Statement   

   Safe Harbor Statement under the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:   Statements
herein that relate to future operating periods are subject to important risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Actions
by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks may affect the costs
and expenses of financing the Company and the rates it is able to offer. The
Company s business is affected by general economic conditions in and the
political instability of the global markets in which the Company operates
because deteriorating economic conditions and political instability can result
in higher loan losses. The Company s business is also affected by actions of
banks, financing and leasing companies and other lenders that compete with the
Company for customers. In addition, the Company s business is closely related
to John Deere s business. Further information, including factors that
potentially could materially affect the Company s and John Deere s financial
results, is included in the most recent Deere   Company Form 10-K and other
Deere   Company and Capital Corporation filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. 

   Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements   

  The Company has periodically sold retail notes to
special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions.  The Company has used these SPEs in a manner
consistent with conventional practices in the securitization industry to   

20     

isolate the retail notes for the benefit of securitization investors.
The use of the SPEs has enabled the Company to access the highly liquid and
efficient securitization markets for the sales of these types of financial
assets. The amounts of funding the Company chooses to obtain from
securitizations reflect such factors as capital market accessibility, relative
costs of funding sources and assets available for securitization. The Company s
total exposure to recourse provisions related to securitized retail notes,
which were sold in prior periods, was $97 million and the total assets held by
the SPEs related to these securitizations were $903 million at October 31,
2006.  

  At  October
31, 2006, the Company had approximately $3 million of guarantees issued
primarily to banks outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the
retail financing of John Deere equipment. The Company may recover a portion of
any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the
equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October 31, 2006, the Company had
accrued losses of approximately $.2 million under these agreements. The maximum
remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October 31, 2006 was
approximately five years. 

  At
October 31, 2006, the Company had $410 million of guarantees issued to turbine
manufacturers for John Deere Renewables, LLC wind turbine purchases. John Deere
Renewables, LLC is an affiliated company that has commitments to purchase wind
turbines related to its direct investments in wind energy projects.  

  The Company s subsidiary, John Deere Risk
Protection, Inc., offers crop insurance products through a managing general
agency agreement (Agreement) with an insurance company (Insurance Carrier)
rated  Excellent  by A.M. Best Company. As a managing general agent, John Deere
Risk Protection, Inc. will receive commissions from the Insurance Carrier for
selling crop insurance to producers.  The
Company has guaranteed certain obligations under the Agreement, including the
obligation to pay the Insurance Carrier for any uncollected premiums. At
October 31, 2006 the maximum exposure for uncollected premiums was
approximately $34 million. Substantially all of the Company s crop insurance
risk under the Agreement has been mitigated by a syndicate of private
reinsurance companies. These reinsurance companies are rated  Excellent  or
higher by A.M. Best Company. In the event of a widespread catastrophic crop
failure throughout the U.S. and the default of these highly rated private
reinsurance companies on their reinsurance obligations, the Company would be
required to reimburse the Insurance Carrier for the maximum exposure under the
Agreement of approximately $432 million at October 31, 2006. The Company
believes that the likelihood of the occurrence of substantially all of the
events that give rise to the exposure under this Agreement is extremely remote
and as a result, at October 31, 2006, the Company has accrued probable losses
of approximately $.2 million under the Agreement.  

   Aggregate
Contractual Obligations   

  Most
of the Company s contractual obligations to make payments to third parties are
on-balance-sheet debt obligations. In addition, the Company has
off-balance-sheet obligations for the purchase of services along with interest
on debt and operating lease payments. The payment schedule for these
contractual obligations at October 31, 2006 in millions of dollars is as follows:  

*                                            Principal
payments 

  **                                     Notes
payable of $2,194 million classified as short-term on the balance sheet related
to securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the
expected payment schedule (see Note 7). 

  These contractual obligations do not include unused
commitments to extend credit to customers and John Deere dealers as discussed
in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

21     

Critical Accounting
Policies   

  The
preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions
could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting
policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the
preparation of the Company s financial statements and require the most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The Company s other accounting
policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

   Allowance for Credit Losses   

  The allowance for credit losses
represents an estimate of the losses expected from the Company s Receivable
portfolio.  The level of the allowance is
based on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss
experience by product category, portfolio duration, delinquency trends,
economic conditions and credit risk quality. The adequacy of the allowance is
assessed quarterly.  Different
assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the
allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses.  

  The total allowance for credit losses at October 31,
2006, 2005, and 2004 were $93 million, $96 million, and $113 million,
respectively. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to continued strong credit
quality and a decrease in non-performing Receivables.  

  The assumptions used in evaluating the Company s
exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. The
historical loss experience on the Receivable portfolios represents one of the
key assumptions involved in determining the allowance for credit losses. Over
the last five fiscal years, the average loss experience has fluctuated between
1 basis point and 11 basis points in any given fiscal year over the applicable
prior period. Holding other estimates constant, a 5 basis point increase or
decrease in estimated loss experience on the Receivable portfolios would result
in an increase or decrease of approximately $8 million to the allowance for
credit losses at October 31, 2006.  

   Operating Lease Residual Values   

  The carrying value of the equipment
on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment
at the end of the lease (residual values). 
Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the
lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the Company may record a gain or
a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sales
price.  The residual values are dependent
on current economic conditions and are reviewed quarterly. Changes in residual
value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the
amount of investment in equipment on operating leases.  

  The total operating lease residual values at October
31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $511 million, $450 million, and $461
million, respectively.  The increase in
2006 was primarily due to the increase in the level of operating leases.  

  Estimates used in determining end of lease market
values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and
timing of depreciation expense.  If
future market values for this equipment were to decrease 5 percent from
the Company s present estimates, the total impact would be to increase the
Company s annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by
approximately $9 million.  

    Item 7A  .   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk .  

   Financial Instrument Risk Information   

  The Company is naturally exposed to various interest
rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, the Company enters into
derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the
normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative
positions or trading. The Company manages the relationship of the types and   

22     

amounts of its funding sources to its Receivable and Lease portfolios
in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency
fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities.
Accordingly, from time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap
agreements to manage its interest rate exposure. The Company also has foreign
currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to
buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies.
The Company has entered into agreements related to the management of these
currency transaction risks. The credit risk under these interest rate and
foreign currency agreements is not considered to be significant. See Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detailed financial
instrument information.  

   Interest Rate Risk   

  Quarterly, the Company uses a combination of cash flow
models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest
rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the
effect of adjusting interest rates as follows. Cash flows for Receivables are
discounted at the current prevailing rate for each Receivable portfolio. Cash
flows for borrowings are discounted at the treasury yield curve plus a market
credit spread for similarly rated borrowers. Cash flows for securitized
borrowings are discounted at the industrial composite bond curve for similarly
rated borrowers. Cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and
discounted using forecasted rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing
dates. The net loss in these financial instruments  fair values which would be
caused by increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at
October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 would have been approximately $63 million
and $35 million, respectively.  

   Foreign Currency
Risk   

  The Company s policy is to hedge the foreign currency
risk if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the
Receivable portfolio.  As a result, a
hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative
to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the Company s
cash flows.

   REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   

  John
Deere Capital Corporation:  

  We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of John Deere Capital
Corporation and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of October 31, 2006 and 2005
and the related statements of consolidated income and retained earnings, of
changes in consolidated stockholder s equity and of consolidated cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2006.  These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company s management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.  

  We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  The Company is
not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
control over financial reporting.  Our
audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

  In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2006
and 2005 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended October 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

John Deere Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements     

Note 1  .    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

  The following are significant accounting policies in
addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial
statements.  

   Corporate Organization   

  John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation)
and its subsidiaries are collectively called the Company. John Deere Credit
Company, a wholly-owned finance holding subsidiary of Deere   Company, is
the parent of the Company. The Company conducts business in Australia, New
Zealand, the U.S., and in several countries in Europe and Latin America. Deere
  Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively called John
Deere.  

  Retail notes, revolving charge accounts, operating
loans, financing leases and wholesale receivables are collectively called  Receivables. 
Receivables and operating leases are collectively called  Receivables and
Leases.   

  The Company bears substantially all of the credit risk
(net of recovery from withholdings from certain John Deere dealers, and
customer guarantees from certain John Deere dealers and Farm Plan    
and PowerPlan    merchants) associated with its holding of
Receivables and Leases. A small portion of the Receivables and Leases held
(less than 5 percent) is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Deere  
Company. The Company also performs substantially all servicing and collection
functions. Servicing and collection functions for a small portion of the
Receivables and Leases held (less than 5 percent) are provided by John Deere.
John Deere is reimbursed for staff and other administrative services at
estimated cost, and for credit lines provided to the Company based on
utilization of those lines. 

   Principles of
Consolidation   

  The consolidated financial statements include the
financial statements of the Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries. The
consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies
in which the Capital Corporation has a controlling interest. The Capital
Corporation records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company at
its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate. Certain special purpose
entities (SPEs) related to the securitization of financing receivables for secured
borrowings, which are variable interest entities (VIEs), are consolidated since
the Company is the primary beneficiary for these VIEs. Certain other SPEs
related to the securitization and sale of financing receivables, which are also
VIEs, are not consolidated since the Company does not control these entities,
and they either meet the requirements of qualified SPEs or the Company is not
the primary beneficiary.  In addition,
the specified assets in these unconsolidated VIEs related to the Company s
securitizations are not the only source of payment for specified liabilities or
other interests of these VIEs and, therefore, do not require consolidation (see
Note 4).  

   Use of Estimates
in Financial Statements   

  The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

   Revenue Recognition   

  Financing revenue is recorded over
the lives of the related receivables using the interest method. Deferred costs
on the origination of receivables are recognized as a reduction in finance
revenue over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest method. Income
from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled
lease terms.  

34     

Securitization of
Receivables    

  Certain
financing receivables are periodically transferred to SPEs in securitization
transactions (see Note 4). For securitizations that qualify as sales of
receivables, the gains or losses from the sales are recognized in the period of
sale based on the relative fair value of the portion sold and the portion
allocated to retained interests. The retained interests are recorded at fair
value estimated by discounting future cash flows. Changes in these fair values
are recorded after-tax in other comprehensive income in unrealized gain or loss
on investments. Other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in net income.
For securitizations that qualify as collateral for secured borrowings, no gains
or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. These receivables
remain on the balance sheet and are classified as  Restricted securitized
retail notes.  The Company recognizes finance income over the lives of these
retail notes using the interest method.  

   Depreciation   

  Equipment on
operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the
straight-line method (see Note 5).  

   Derivative Financial
Instruments   

  It is the Company s policy that derivative
transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal course
of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or
trading. The Company manages the relationship of the types and amounts of funding
sources to its receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due
to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to
favorable financing opportunities. The Company also has foreign currency
exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to financing
in currencies other than the local currencies.  

  All
derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Each derivative is
designated as either a cash flow hedge or a fair value hedge, or remains undesignated.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as
cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to
the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized
in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net
income and offset to the extent the hedge was effective by the fair value
changes in the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges
are recognized currently in the income statement. All ineffective changes in
derivative fair values are recognized currently in net income.  

  All
designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the
hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on
an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness,
when applicable. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly
effective as a hedge, or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely
to occur, or the derivative is terminated, the hedge accounting discussed above
is discontinued and any past or future changes in the derivative s fair value
that will not be effective as an offset to the income effects of the item being
hedged are recognized currently in the income statement (see Note 18).  

   Foreign Currency
Translation   

  The functional currencies for most of the Company s
foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and
liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of
the period exchange rates, and the revenues and expenses are translated at
weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these
translations are included in other comprehensive income, which is part of
stockholder s equity. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and
foreign exchange forward contracts and options are included in net income or
other comprehensive income as appropriate. The total foreign exchange pretax
net loss for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $.5 million, $.5 million and $1.0 million,
respectively.  

35     

New Accounting Standards Adopted   

  Certain employees of the
Company participate in Deere   Company share-based compensation plans.
Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2006, the Company adopted FASB Statement
No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, using the modified prospective
method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior periods. The
revised standard eliminated the intrinsic value method of accounting for
share-based employee compensation under APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. The revised standard generally requires the recognition
of the cost of employee services for share-based compensation based on the
grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The effect
of adoption of the new standard in 2006 for the Company was an additional
expense of $5.7 million pretax, or $3.6 million after-tax. Further
disclosure for these plans is included in Deere   Company s Form 10-K
for the year ended October 31, 2006.  

  At October 31, 2006, the Company
adopted FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations. This Interpretation relates to legal obligations
associated with retirement of tangible long-lived assets that result from the
acquisition, construction, or normal operations of the asset. Under this
standard, an accrual is required for these legal asset retirement obligations
in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on future events
that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The accrual is
recorded as an increase in the cost basis of the related property and
recognized in expense over the useful life of the asset. The adoption of this
Interpretation did not have a material effect on the Company s financial
position or net income. The pro forma effects on all years presented were also
not material.  

   New Accounting Standards to be Adopted    

  In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement No. 154, Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections. This Statement requires voluntary changes in accounting
principles to be recorded retrospectively for prior periods presented rather
than a cumulative adjustment in the current period. This treatment would also
be required for new accounting pronouncements if there are no specific
transition provisions. The accounting for changes in estimates in the current
period and the accounting for errors as restatements of prior periods has not
changed. In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 155, Accounting for
Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments. This Statement primarily resolves certain
issues addressed in the implementation of FASB Statement No. 133 concerning
beneficial interests in securitized financial assets. In March 2006, the FASB
issued Statement No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets. This
Statement clarifies the criteria for recognizing servicing assets and
liabilities, requires these items to be initially measured at fair value and
permits subsequent measurements on either an amortization or fair value basis.
The effective date of these Statements is the beginning of fiscal year 2007.
The adoption of these Statements is not expected to have a material effect on
the Company s financial position or net income.  

  In September 2006, FASB issued
Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. These methods will apply
to other accounting standards, which use fair value measurements and may change
the application of certain measurements used in current practice. The effective
date is the beginning of fiscal year 2009. The adoption is not expected to have
a material effect on the Company s financial position or net income.  

   The Company is a
participating employer in certain Deere   Company sponsored defined benefit
pension plans for employees in the U.S. and certain defined benefit pension
plans outside the U.S. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,
Employers  Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans. This Statement requires retirement benefit accruals or prepaid benefit
costs on the balance sheet to be adjusted to the difference between the benefit
obligations and the plan assets at fair value. The offset to the adjustment is
recorded directly in stockholder s equity net of tax. The amount recorded in
stockholder s equity would represent the after-tax unrecognized actuarial gains
or losses and unamortized prior service costs. This Statement also requires all
benefit obligations and plan assets to be measured at fiscal year end. The
effective date for the funded status adjustment is the end of fiscal year 2007
and the year-end measurement date is fiscal year 2009. The adoption of this
Statement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial
position or net income. The Company does not expect violations of any credit agreements
as a result of adopting this new standard.    Further disclosure for these plans is
included in Deere   Company s Form 10-K for the year ended
October 31, 2006. 

36     

In June 2006, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.
This interpretation clarifies the recognition for uncertain tax positions
should be based on a more-likely-than-not threshold that the tax position will
be sustained upon audit. The tax position is measured as the amount of benefit
that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. The effective date is the beginning of fiscal year 2008 with the
cumulative effect reported as an adjustment to the beginning retained earnings.
The Company is currently reviewing the impact of this new standard and has not
determined the potential effect on the financial statements.  

    Note 2  .    Receivables    

   Retail Notes Receivable   

  The Company provides and administers financing for
retail purchases of new equipment manufactured by John Deere s agricultural,
construction and forestry, and commercial and consumer equipment divisions and
used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. The Company purchases retail
installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from John Deere. These
retail notes are acquired by John Deere through John Deere equipment retail
dealers. The Company also purchases and finances a limited amount of retail
notes unrelated to John Deere.  

  Retail notes receivable
by product category at October 31 are as follows (in millions of dollars):  

Retail notes acquired by the Company during the years
ended October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 had an estimated average original term
(based on dollar amounts) of 53, 53 and 54 months, respectively. Historically,
because of prepayments, the average actual life of retail notes has been
considerably shorter than the average original term. The average actual life
for retail notes liquidated in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 34, 35 and
35 months, respectively.  

37     

Gross retail note installments at October 31 are
scheduled to be received as follows (in millions of dollars):  

Company guidelines relating to down payment
requirements and contract terms on retail notes are generally as follows:  

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company received
proceeds from the sale of Receivables (including securitized sales) of $143
million, $133 million and $2,219 million, respectively. The Company acts as
agent for the buyers in collection and administration for virtually all of the
Receivables it has sold. All Receivables sold are collateralized by security
agreements on the related equipment. The Company s estimated maximum exposure
under all Receivable and Lease recourse provisions at October 31, 2006, 2005
and 2004 was $105 million, $140 million and $203 million, respectively. In
addition, the Company has provided letters of credit for John Deere Credit
Inc., the John Deere finance subsidiary in Canada, as part of retail note
sales. At October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the maximum exposure under these
agreements was approximately $7 million, $ 7 million and $8 million,
respectively. The Company does not record the recourse obligations as
liabilities as they are contingent liabilities that are remote at this time.
However, the probable loss on receivables that have been sold was accrued at
the time of sale, and any subsequent necessary adjustments are made as part of
ongoing reviews. At October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the balance of all
Receivables and Leases previously sold, but still administered by the Company,
was $954 million, $1,719 million and $3,052 million, respectively.  

  Finance income is recognized over the lives of the
retail notes using the interest method. During 2006, the average effective
yield on retail notes held by the Company was approximately 7.3 percent,
compared with 6.6 percent in 2005 and 6.3 percent in 2004. Unearned
finance income on variable-rate retail notes is adjusted monthly based on
fluctuations in the base rate of a specified bank. Costs incurred in the
acquisition of retail notes are deferred and recognized over the expected lives
of the retail notes using the interest method.  

  A portion of the finance income earned by the Company
arises from financing of retail sales of John Deere equipment on which finance
charges are waived or reduced by John Deere for a period from the date of sale
to a specified subsequent date. The Company receives compensation from John
Deere equal to competitive market interest rates for periods during which
finance charges have been waived or reduced on retail notes and leases.  The Company computes the compensation from
John Deere for waived or reduced finance charges based on the  

38     

Company s estimated funding costs, administrative and operating
expenses, credit losses, and required return on equity. The finance income
earned following the waiver or interest reduction period is not significantly
different from the compensation earned from John Deere. The portions of the
Company s finance income earned that were received from John Deere on retail
notes containing waiver of finance charges or reduced rates were 22 percent in
2006, 22 percent in 2005 and 25 percent in 2004. During 2006, 2005 and
2004, the finance income earned from Deere   Company on retail notes
containing waiver of finance charges or reduced rates was $158 million,
$116 million and $96 million, respectively.  

  A deposit equal to one percent of the face amount of
certain John Deere agricultural and commercial and consumer equipment retail
notes originating from each dealer is withheld by the Company from that dealer.
Any subsequent retail note losses are charged against the withheld deposits. At
the end of each calendar quarter, the balance of each dealer s withholding
account in excess of a specified percent (ranging from one to three percent
based on dealer qualifications) of the total balance outstanding on retail
notes originating with that dealer is remitted to the dealer. To the extent that
these deposits withheld from the dealer from whom the retail note was acquired
cannot absorb a loss on a retail note, it is charged against the Company s
allowance for credit losses. There is no withholding of dealer deposits on John
Deere construction and forestry equipment retail notes or recreational product
retail notes.  

  The Company requires that theft and physical damage
insurance be carried on all goods leased or securing retail notes and wholesale
receivables. The customer may, at his own expense, have the Company or the
seller of the goods purchase this insurance or obtain it from other sources.  

   Revolving Charge Accounts Receivable   

  Revolving charge account income is generated primarily
by three revolving credit products: Farm Plan    ,
PowerPlan    and the John Deere Credit Revolving Plan. Farm
Plan    is primarily used by farmers and ranchers to
finance day-to-day operating expenses, such as parts and services. Merchants
offer Farm Plan    as an alternative to carrying in-house accounts
receivable, and can initially sell existing balances to the Company under a
recourse arrangement. Farm Plan    income includes a
discount paid by merchants for transaction processing and support, and finance
charges paid by customers on their outstanding account balances. PowerPlan   
is primarily used by construction companies to finance day-to-day operating
expenses, such as parts and service, and is otherwise similar to Farm Plan   .  Merchants offer PowerPlan   
as an alternative to carrying in-house accounts receivable, and can initially
sell existing balances to the Company under a recourse arrangement. PowerPlan   
income includes a discount paid by merchants for transaction processing and
support and finance charges paid by customers on their outstanding account
balances.  The John Deere Credit
Revolving Plan is used primarily by retail customers of John Deere dealers to
finance commercial and consumer equipment. Income includes a discount paid by
dealers on most transactions and finance charges paid by customers on their
outstanding account balances. Revolving charge accounts receivable at October
31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $1,512 million and $1,528 million, respectively.
Generally, account holders may pay the account balance in full at any time, or
make payments over a number of months according to a payment schedule. 

   Operating Loans   

  Operating loan income is generated primarily by
operating loans that are offered through several leading farm input providers
or through direct relationships with agricultural producers to finance the
acquisition of materials such as seeds and fertilizers. Income on this product
is generated from finance charges paid by customers on their outstanding
account balances. Operating loan receivables totaled $379 million and $384
million at October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

39     

Financing Leases   

  The Company leases agricultural, construction and
forestry, commercial and consumer and certain other equipment directly to
retail customers. At the time of accepting a lease that qualifies as a
financing lease under FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, the Company
records the gross amount of lease payments receivable, estimated residual value
of the leased equipment and unearned finance income. The unearned finance
income is equal to the excess of the gross lease receivable plus the estimated
residual value over the cost of the equipment. The unearned finance income is
recognized as revenue over the lease term using the interest method. Lease
acquisition costs are accounted for in a manner similar to the procedures for
retail notes.  

  Financing leases
receivable by product category at October 31 are as follows (in millions of
dollars):  

Initial lease terms for financing leases generally
range from 36 months to 60 months. Payments on financing leases receivable at
October 31 are scheduled as follows (in millions of dollars):  

Deposits withheld from John Deere dealers and related
losses on financing leases are handled in a manner similar to the procedures
for retail notes. As with retail notes, there are no deposits withheld from
dealers on financing leases related to construction and forestry equipment. In
addition, a lease payment discount program, allowing reduced payments over the
term of the lease, is administered in a manner similar to finance waiver on
retail notes.  

  Equipment returned to the Company upon termination of
leases and held for subsequent sale or lease is recorded at the lower of net
book value or estimated market value of the equipment.  

40     

Wholesale Receivables   

  The Company also finances wholesale
inventories of John Deere agricultural equipment, commercial and consumer
equipment and construction and forestry equipment owned by dealers of those
products in the form of wholesale receivables. Wholesale finance income related
to these notes is generally recognized monthly based on the daily balance of
wholesale receivables outstanding and the applicable effective interest rate.
Interest rates vary with a bank base rate, the type of equipment financed and
the balance outstanding. Substantially all of wholesale receivables are secured
by equipment financed. The average actual life for wholesale receivables is
less than 12 months.  

  The Company purchases certain wholesale receivables
(trade receivables) from John Deere. These trade receivables arise from John
Deere s sales of goods to dealers. Under the terms of the sales to dealers,
interest is charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the
date when goods are sold to retail customers by the dealer or the expiration of
certain interest-free periods granted to the dealer at the time of the sale,
until payment is received by the Company. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after
goods are shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not
sold to retail customers. The interest-free periods are determined based on the
type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range
from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be
extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven and interest rates, which exceed
the prime rate, are set based on market factors. The Company receives
compensation from John Deere equal to competitive market interest rates for
these interest-free periods. The Company computes the compensation from John
Deere for interest-free periods based on the Company s estimated funding costs,
administrative and operating expenses, credit losses, and required return on
equity. The finance income earned following the interest-free period is not
significantly different from the compensation earned from John Deere. During
2006, 2005 and 2004, the compensation earned from John Deere was $240 million,
$219 million and $200 million, respectively.  

   Other Receivables   

  The Company has sold retail notes to limited-purpose
business trusts and to private third parties, which utilize the notes as
collateral for asset-backed securities issued. Other receivables related to
securitizations are recorded at net present value and relate to payments to be
received for retained interests. These retained interests are subsequently
carried at estimated fair value with other-than-temporary impairments to fair
value included in income. Securitization and servicing fee income includes the
interest earned on these retained interests and reimbursed administrative
expenses.  

   Concentration of Credit Risk   

  Receivables have significant concentrations of credit
risk in the agricultural, construction and forestry, and commercial and
consumer business sectors as shown in the previous tables. On a geographic
basis, there is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area
in which the Company operates. The Company retains as collateral a security
interest in the goods associated with Receivables other than certain revolving
charge accounts.  

41  

Note 3  .    Allowance for Credit Losses, Delinquencies and Write-offs   

   Allowance for Credit Losses   

  Allowances for credit losses on Receivables are
maintained in amounts considered to be appropriate in relation to the
Receivables outstanding based on collection experience, economic conditions and
credit risk quality.  

  An analysis of the allowance for credit losses on
total Receivables follows (in millions of dollars):  

The allowance for credit losses represented .55
percent, .63 percent and .89 percent of Receivables financed at October 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In addition, the Company had $177 million,
$166 million and $168 million at October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, of deposits primarily withheld from John Deere dealers available
for certain potential credit losses originating from those dealers.  

   Delinquencies   

  Generally, when retail notes become 120 days
delinquent, accrual of finance income is suspended, the collateral is
repossessed or the account is designated for litigation and the estimated
uncollectible amount, after charging the dealer s withholding account, if any,
is written off to the allowance for credit losses. Accrual of revolving charge
account income is suspended generally when the account becomes 120 days
delinquent. Accounts are deemed to be uncollectible and written off to the
allowance for credit losses when delinquency reaches 120 days for a Farm Plan    ,
PowerPlan    or John Deere Credit Revolving Plan account.
When a financing lease account becomes 120 days delinquent, the accrual of
lease revenue is suspended, the equipment is repossessed or the account is
designated for litigation, and the estimated uncollectible amount, after
charging the dealer s withholding account, if any, is written off to the
allowance for credit losses. Generally, when a wholesale receivable becomes 60
days delinquent, the Company determines whether the accrual of finance income
on interest-bearing wholesale receivables should be suspended, the collateral
should be repossessed or the account should be designated for litigation and
the estimated uncollectible amount written off to the allowance for credit
losses.

Total Receivable amounts
60 days or more past due in the table below represent the amount of all
customer payments past due 60 days or more, by product, and as a percent of the
respective receivables. They are as follows (in millions of dollars):  

*                                           Due to the nature of
revolving charge accounts, the customer payments past due 60 days or more also
represent the total balance.

Note 4  .    Retail Note Securitizations   

  The Company, as a part of its overall funding
strategy, periodically transfers certain receivables (retail notes) into
special purpose entities (SPEs) as part of its asset-backed securities programs
(securitizations) involving its retail notes. 
For securitizations entered into prior to 2005, the structure of these
transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes met the criteria of
sales in accordance with FASB Statement No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities. Beginning in
2005, the transfer of retail notes into new securitization transactions did not
meet the sales criteria of FASB Statement No. 140 and are, therefore, accounted
for as secured borrowings.  SPEs
utilized in securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included
in the Company s consolidated statements because the assets they hold are
legally isolated. For bankruptcy analysis purposes, the Capital Corporation has
sold the receivables to the SPEs in a true sale and the SPEs are separate legal
entities. Use of the assets held by the SPEs is restricted by terms of the
documents governing the securitization transaction. Further information related
to the secured borrowings and sales of retail notes is provided below. 

   Secured Borrowings   

  Beginning in 2005, the Company s new securitizations
of retail notes were accounted for as secured borrowings. Retail notes related
to these programs were transferred to certain SPEs which in turn issued debt to
investors. The resulting secured borrowings are included in short-term
borrowings on the balance sheet as shown in the following table. The
securitized retail notes are recorded as  Restricted securitized retail notes 
on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related
to these securitizations include the restricted securitized retail notes less
an allowance for credit losses, and other assets representing restricted cash
as shown in the following table. In addition to the restricted assets shown in
the table, a reserve fund included in  Other receivables  related to retained
interests for certain securitizations that qualified as sales of receivables is
also available as a credit enhancement for securitizations related to certain
secured borrowings. The amounts of this reserve fund at October 31, 2006 and
2005 were $22 million and $42 million, respectively. The SPEs supporting
the secured borrowings to which the retail notes are transferred are
consolidated unless the Company is not the primary beneficiary or the SPE is a
qualified special purpose entity as defined in FASB Statement No. 140.  

44     

The total components of consolidated restricted assets related to secured
borrowings in securitization transactions at October 31 were as follows (in
millions of dollars):  

The components of the secured borrowings and other
liabilities related to these securitizations at October 31 were as follows (in
millions of dollars):  

The secured borrowings related to these restricted
securitized retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes
are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash
flows generated by the restricted assets and the reserve fund mentioned above.
The consolidated assets (restricted retail notes) relating to an SPE in which
the Company is the primary beneficiary, and, therefore, the SPE is consolidated
under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, were $1,147 million and $650 million at October 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively. These restricted retail notes are included in the
restricted securitized retail notes related to securitizations shown in the
table above. At October 31, 2006, the maximum remaining term of all restricted
receivables was approximately six years.  

   Sales of Receivables   

  Prior to 2005, the Company
periodically transferred certain retail notes into SPEs as part of its
securitization program in transactions that were structured such that the
transfer of the retail notes met the criteria of sales in accordance with FASB
Statement No. 140. The SPEs issue asset-backed securities to investors and use
the proceeds of the debt issuance to pay for the retail notes. However, the
Company retains certain interests in the SPE s assets including interest-only
strips and, in some cases, reserve accounts and subordinated certificates.
These retained interests are carried at estimated fair value in  Other
receivables  or  Other assets  on the balance sheet. Gains or losses on sales
of the receivables depended in part on the previous carrying amount of the
financial assets involved in the transfer, allocated between the assets sold
and the retained interest based on their relative fair values at the date of
transfer. The Company generally estimates fair values based on the present
value of future expected cash flows using management s key assumptions as
discussed below. The Company retains the rights to certain future cash flows
and receives annual servicing fees approximating one percent of the outstanding
balance. No significant balances for servicing assets or liabilities exist
because the benefits received for servicing are just adequate to compensate the
servicer for the costs of providing the servicing. The Company s maximum exposure
under recourse provisions related to securitized sold retail notes at October
31, 2006 and 2005 was $97 million and $138 million, respectively. The
recourse provisions contractually specified by the documents governing the
securitization transaction are contingent liabilities that are remote at this
time. Except for this exposure, the investors and securitization trusts have no
recourse to the Company for failure of debtors to pay when due. The Company s
retained interests are subordinate to investors  interests and their values are
subject to certain key assumptions as shown below. The total assets of the
unconsolidated SPEs related to these securitizations at October 31, 2006 and
2005 were $903 million and $1,754 million, respectively. At October
31, 2006, the maximum remaining term of these receivables sold was
approximately four years.  

45     

Pretax
gains on securitized retail notes sold (none in 2006 and 2005) and key
assumptions used to initially determine the fair value of the retained
interests were as follows:

dollars were as follows:  

Components of retained
interests in securitized retail notes sold at October 31 were as follows (in
millions of dollars):  

The total retained
interests, weighted-average life, weighted-average current key economic
assumptions and the sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effects on
the retained interests from immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse
changes in those assumptions with dollars in millions were as follows:  

These
sensitivities are hypothetical changes in fair value and cannot be extrapolated
because the relationship of the changes in assumption to the changes in fair
value may not be linear.  Also, the
effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing
any other assumption, whereas changes in one factor may result in changes in another.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that
actual results would be consistent with the results of these estimates.

Principal balances of
owned, securitized retail notes sold and total managed retail notes; past due
amounts; and credit losses (net of recoveries), as of and for the years ended
October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 in millions of dollars follow:  

The amount of actual and projected future credit
losses as a percent of the original balance of securitized retail notes sold
(expected static pool losses) were as follows:  

Note 5  .    Equipment on Operating Leases   

  Rental payments applicable to equipment on operating
leases are recorded as income on a straight-line method over the lease terms.
Operating lease assets are recorded at cost and depreciated to their estimated
residual value generally on a straight-line method over the terms of the
leases. Residual values represent estimates of the value of the leased assets
at the end of the contract terms and are initially determined based upon
appraisals and estimates. Residual values are continually reviewed to determine
that estimated amounts are appropriate.  

  The cost of equipment on operating leases by product
category at October 31 is as follows (in millions of dollars):  

47     

Initial lease terms for
equipment on operating leases generally range from 36 months to 60 months.
Rental payments for equipment on operating leases at October 31 are scheduled
as follows (in millions of dollars):  

As with construction and forestry retail notes, there
are no deposits withheld from dealers on operating leases related to
construction and forestry equipment. In addition, a lease payment discount
program, allowing reduced payments over the term of the lease, is administered
in a manner similar to finance waiver on retail notes.  

  Equipment returned to the Company upon termination of
leases and held for subsequent sale or lease is recorded at the lower of net
book value or estimated market value of the equipment.  

  Total
operating lease amounts 60 days or more past due represent the amount of all
customer payments past due 60 days or more. These amounts were $1 million at
October 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.  

    Note 6  .    Notes Receivable from John Deere   

  The Company invests in wind energy generation by
making loans to certain affiliated companies that have directly invested in
wind energy projects. On October 31, 2006, notes receivable from John Deere
related to wind energy loans were $239 million. The Company receives interest
from John Deere equal to competitive market interest rates. These notes
generally have original contractual maturities of up to ten years. At October
31, 2006, the maximum remaining term of the notes was approximately ten years.
The Company has received security interests in the assets of John Deere
Renewables, LLC as collateral on these loans.  

    Note 7  .    Short-Term Borrowings   

  On October 31, 2006, short-term borrowings were $7,143
million, $2,290 million of which was commercial paper. Short-term borrowings
were $5,767 million on October 31, 2005, $1,696 million of which was commercial
paper. The Company s short-term borrowings include $2,194 million and $1,353
million of secured borrowings at October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively (see
Note 4). Although these notes payable are classified as short-term since
payment is required if the retail notes are liquidated early, the payment
schedule for these borrowings based on the expected liquidations of the retail
notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2007 - $811, 2008 - $614, 2009 -
$442, 2010 - $267 and 2011 - $60. The Company s short-term debt also includes
amounts borrowed from John Deere, which totaled $178 million and $275
million at October 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company pays interest
on a monthly basis to John Deere for these borrowings based on a current market
rate. The weighted-average interest rate on total short-term borrowings at
October 31, 2006 and 2005, excluding current maturities of long-term
borrowings, was 5.2 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively.  

  Lines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks
were $3,016 million at October 31, 2006. Some of these credit lines are
available to both the Company and Deere   Company. At October 31, 2006,
$410 million of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing unused credit lines,
commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings
and the current portion of long-term borrowings, of the Company and John Deere
were considered to constitute utilization.  

48     

Included in the above lines of credit was a long-term credit facility
agreement for $3 billion, expiring in February 2011.  The agreement is
mutually extendable and the annual facility fee is not significant. The credit
agreement requires the Company to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings
to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the
ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base
(total subordinated debt and stockholder s equity excluding accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 8.5 to 1 at the end of any
fiscal quarter.  Senior debt  consists of the Company s total interest-bearing
obligations, excluding subordinated debt and certain securitization
indebtedness, but including borrowings from John Deere. All of these
requirements of the credit agreement have been met during the periods included
in the financial statements. The facility fee on these lines of credit is
divided between Deere   Company and the Company based on the proportion of
their respective commercial paper outstanding.  

  Deere   Company has an agreement with the Company
pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own at least 51 percent of the
voting shares of capital stock of the Company and to maintain the Company s
consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million.  This agreement also obligates Deere  
Company to make income maintenance payments to the Company such that its
consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for
each fiscal quarter. For 2006 and 2005, the Company s ratios were 1.60 to 1 and
1.88 to 1, respectively, and never less than 1.53 to 1 and 1.74 to 1 for any
fiscal quarter of 2006 and 2005, respectively. Deere   Company s
obligations to make payments to the Company under the agreement are independent
of whether the Company is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other
liabilities. Further, Deere   Company s obligations under the agreement are
not measured by the amount of the Company s indebtedness, obligations or other
liabilities. Deere   Company s obligations to make payments under this
agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific
indebtedness, obligation or liability of the Company and are enforceable only
by or in the name of the Company. No payments were required under this
agreement during the periods included in the financial statements.  

    Note 8  .    Long-Term Borrowings   

  Long-term
borrowings of the Company at October 31 consisted of the following (in millions
of dollars):  

*               Includes fair
value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.  

  **           All interest rates
are as of year-end.  

  The approximate principal amounts of long-term
borrowings maturing in each of the next five years, in millions of dollars, are
as follows: 2007 - $2,469, 2008 - $2,893, 2009 - $1,760, 2010 - $849 and 2011 -
$746.  

49  

Note 9  .    Leases   

  Total rental expense for operating leases was $4
million, $5 million and $4 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At
October 31, 2006, future minimum lease payments under operating
leases amounted to $8 million as follows (in millions of dollars): 2007 - $3,
2008 - $2, 2009 - $1, 2010 - $1 and 2011 - $1.  

    Note 10  .  Common
Stock   

  All of the Company s
common stock is owned by John Deere Credit Company, a wholly-owned finance
holding subsidiary of Deere   Company. No shares of common stock of the
Company were reserved for officers or employees or for options, warrants,
conversions or other rights at October 31, 2006 or 2005. At October 31,
2006, the Company had authorized, but not issued, 10,000 shares of $1 par value
preferred stock.    

    Note 11  .  Dividends   

  The Capital Corporation declared and paid $85 million in dividends to
John Deere Credit Company in 2006 and $150 million in 2005.  In each case, John Deere Credit Company paid
comparable dividends to Deere   Company.   

    Note 12  .  Pension
and Other Retirement Benefits   

  The Company is a participating employer in certain
Deere   Company sponsored defined benefit pension plans for employees in
the U.S. and certain defined benefit pension plans outside the U.S. These
pension plans provide for benefits that are based primarily on years of service
and employee compensation. Pension expense is actuarially determined based on
the Company s employees included in the plan. The Company s pension expense
amounted to $5.3 million in 2006, $4.1 million in 2005 and $3.9 million in
2004.   The accumulated
benefit obligation and plan net assets for the employees of the Company are not
determined separately from Deere   Company. 
  The Company generally provides defined benefit health care and life
insurance plans for retired employees in the U.S. as a participating employer
in Deere   Company s sponsored plans. Health care and life insurance
benefits expense is actuarially determined based on the Company s employees
included in the plans and amounted to $6.0 million in 2006, $5.5 million
in 2005 and $6.5 million in 2004. Further disclosure for these plans is
included in the notes to the Deere   Company 2006 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.  

    Note 13  .  Income
Taxes   

   Taxes on Income and
Income Tax Credits   

  The taxable income
of the Company is included in the consolidated U.S. income tax return of
Deere   Company. Provisions for income taxes are made generally
as if the Capital Corporation and each of its subsidiaries filed separate
income tax returns.  

50     

Deferred Income Taxes   

  Deferred income
taxes arise because certain items are treated differently for financial
accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of deferred
income tax assets and liabilities at October 31 is as follows (in millions of
dollars):  

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in
millions of dollars):  

At October 31,
2006, certain tax loss and tax credit carryforwards for $3.4 million were
available, expiring from 2007 through 2023.

Note 15  .   Cash Flow Information   

  For purposes of the statements of consolidated cash flows, the Company
considers investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. Substantially all of the Company s short-term borrowings,
excluding the current maturities of long-term borrowings, mature or may require
payment within three months or less.  

  Cash payments by
the Company for interest incurred on borrowings in 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
$742 million, $484 million and $325 million, respectively. Cash payments
for income taxes during these same periods were $161 million, $164 million and
$136 million, respectively.  

  The
Company had non-cash investing activities not included in the statements of
consolidated cash flows of $128 million for receipt of notes receivable with
John Deere in exchange for property and equipment in 2006.  

    Note 16  .   Commitments and Contingent Liabilities   

  The Company has certain recourse obligations on Receivables
that it has previously sold. If the Receivables sold are not collected, the
Company would be required to cover those losses up to the amount of its
recourse obligation. At October 31, 2006, the maximum amount of exposure to
losses under these agreements was $105 million. The estimated credit risk
associated with sold receivables totaled $3 million at October 31, 2006. This
risk of loss is recognized primarily in the retained interests recorded on the
Company s balance sheet (See Note 4). The Company may recover a portion of any
required payments incurred under these agreements from the repossession of the
equipment collateralizing the Receivables. At October 31, 2006, the maximum
remaining term of the Receivables guaranteed was approximately four years.  

  At October 31, 2006, John Deere Credit Inc., the John Deere finance
subsidiary in Canada, had $63 million of commercial paper and $935 million of
medium-term notes outstanding that were guaranteed by the Company. In addition,
the Company has provided letters of credit for John Deere Credit Inc. as part
of retail note sales. At October 31, 2006, the Company s maximum
exposure under these agreements was approximately $7 million.   At   October 31, 2006, the
Company had approximately $3 million of guarantees issued primarily to banks
outside the U.S. related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of
John Deere equipment. The Company may recover a portion of any required
payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing
the receivables. At October 31, 2006, the Company had accrued losses of
approximately $.2 million under these agreements. The maximum remaining term of
the receivables guaranteed at October 31, 2006 was approximately five years.  

  At
October 31, 2006, the Company had $410 million of guarantees issued to turbine
manufacturers for John Deere Renewables, LLC wind turbine purchases. John Deere
Renewables, LLC is an affiliated company that has commitments to purchase wind
turbines related to its direct investments in wind energy projects.  

  The Company s subsidiary, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc., offers crop
insurance products through a managing general agency agreement (Agreement) with
an insurance company (Insurance Carrier) rated  Excellent  by A.M. Best
Company. As a managing general agent, John Deere Risk Protection, Inc. will
receive commissions from the Insurance Carrier for selling crop insurance to
producers.  The Company has guaranteed
certain obligations under the Agreement, including the obligation to pay the
Insurance Carrier for any uncollected premiums. At  

52     

October
31, 2006 the maximum exposure for uncollected premiums was approximately $34
million. Substantially all of the Company s crop insurance risk under the
Agreement has been mitigated by a syndicate of private reinsurance companies.
These reinsurance companies are rated  Excellent  or higher by A.M. Best
Company. In the event of a widespread catastrophic crop failure throughout the
U.S. and the default of these highly rated private reinsurance companies on
their reinsurance obligations, the Company would be required to reimburse the
Insurance Carrier for the maximum exposure under the Agreement of approximately
$432 million at October 31, 2006. The Company believes that the likelihood
of the occurrence of substantially all of the events that give rise to the
exposure under this Agreement is extremely remote and as a result, at October
31, 2006, the Company has accrued probable losses of approximately $.2 million
under the Agreement.  

  The
Company has commitments to extend credit to customers and John Deere dealers
through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. The Company
applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments to
extend credit as it does for its Receivables. 
Collateral is not required for these commitments, but if credit is
extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of unused
commitments to extend credit to John Deere dealers was $2.5 billion at October
31, 2006. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to customers was
$31.7 billion at October 31, 2006. A significant portion of these commitments
is not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts
do not represent a future cash requirement. The Company generally has the right
to unconditionally cancel, alter, or amend the terms of these commitments at
any time. Over 95 percent of these unused commitments to extend credit to
customers relate to revolving charge accounts.  

  The Company is
subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of
its business, the most prevalent of which relate to state and federal laws and
regulations concerning retail credit. Although it is not possible to predict
with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of
possible loss, the Company believes these unresolved legal actions will not
have a material effect on its financial statements.  

53     

Note 17  .  Other
Comprehensive Income Items   

  Other
comprehensive income items under FASB Statement No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, are transactions recorded in stockholder s equity during
the year, excluding net income and transactions with the stockholder. Following
are the items included in other comprehensive income (loss) and the related tax
effects in millions of dollars:  

*       Reclassification of
retained interest realized gains or losses to net income were not material.  

    Note 18  .   Financial Instruments   

  The fair values of
financial instruments which do not approximate the carrying values in the
financial statements at October 31 are as follows (in millions of dollars):  

*       See Note 7.  

54     

Fair Value Estimates   

  Fair values of the
long-term Receivables with fixed rates were based on the discounted values of
their related cash flows at current market interest rates. The fair values of
the remaining Receivables approximated the carrying amounts.  

  Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term secured borrowings
with fixed rates were based on the discounted values of their related cash
flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been
swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these
long-term borrowings include adjustments related to fair value hedges.                 

   Derivatives   

  All derivative
instruments are recorded at fair values and classified as either other assets
or accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet (see Note 1).  

   Interest Rate Swaps   

  The Company enters
into interest rate swap agreements primarily to more closely match the fixed or
floating interest rates of the borrowings to those of the assets being funded.  

  Certain interest rate swaps were designated as
hedges of future cash flows from commercial paper and variable interest rate
borrowings.  The effective portion of the
fair value gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest expense as
payments are accrued and the swaps approach maturity.  These amounts offset the effects of interest
rate changes on the related borrowings. 
The amount of the gain recorded in other comprehensive income at October
31, 2006 that is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next 12 months
if interest rates remain unchanged is approximately $6 million after-tax. These
swaps mature in up to 55 months.  

  Certain interest
rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate, long-term
borrowings. The effective portion of the fair value gains or losses on these
swaps was offset by fair value adjustments in the underlying borrowings.  

  Any ineffective
portions of the gains or losses on all cash flow and fair value interest rate
swaps designated as hedges were recognized currently in interest expense and
were not material. The amounts of gains or losses reclassified from unrealized
in other comprehensive income to realized in earnings as a result of the
discontinuance of cash flow hedges were not material. There were no components
of cash flow or fair value hedges that were excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness.  

  The Company has
certain interest rate swap agreements that are not designated as hedges under
FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, and the fair value gains or losses are recognized currently in
earnings. These instruments relate to swaps that are used to facilitate certain
borrowings.  

   Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Swaps   

  The Company has
entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps in order to manage
the currency exposure of certain receivables and liabilities. For transactions
not designated as hedges under FASB Statement No. 133, the fair value
gains or losses from these foreign currency derivatives are recognized
currently in earnings, generally offsetting the foreign exchange gains or
losses on the exposures being managed.  

  The Company has designated foreign exchange currency
swaps as cash flow hedges of certain borrowings. The effective portion of the
fair value gains or losses on these swaps is recorded in other comprehensive
income and subsequently reclassified into other operating expenses as payments
are accrued and these instruments approach maturity. This offsets the exchange
rate effects on the borrowing being hedged included in other operating
expenses.  

55     

Any ineffective
portions of the gains or losses on all cash flow and fair value foreign
exchange contracts or swaps designated as hedges were recognized currently in
earnings and were not material. The amounts of gains or losses reclassified
from unrealized in other comprehensive income to realized in earnings as a
result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges were not material. There were
no components of cash flow or fair value hedges that were excluded from the assessment
of effectiveness.

Exhibit 12   

   John Deere Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries 
Computation of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges   
(thousands of dollars)   

Earnings  consist of income before income taxes, the cumulative effect
of changes in accounting and fixed charges.  Fixed charges  consist of interest
on indebtedness, amortization of debt discount and expense, an estimated amount
of rental expense under capitalized leases which is deemed to be representative
of the interest factor and rental expense under operating leases.  

  *        The Company has not issued
preferred stock. Therefore, the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges
and preferred stock dividends are the same as the ratios presented above.
