Item 1.  Business

(a)      Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc. (hereafter the "Registrant")
         was an independent insurance agency handling principally all types of
         casualty, fire and surety insurance.  Registrant was organized as a
         corporation under the laws of the State of Iowa on June 28, 1969, as
         Hynes & Howes Insurance Company.  Because it became apparent this name
         created confusion as to the business of Registrant, an amendment to the
         Articles of the Incorporation was filed on November 17, 1970, with the
         Secretary of the State of Iowa changing the name to Hynes & Howes
         Insurance Counselors, Inc.  This action was ratified by the
         stockholders at a meeting February 5, 1971.

         At the annual stockholders meetings for 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977,
         1978, and 1979, a proposal was made to amend the Articles of
         Incorporation to change the name of the registrant from Hynes & Howes
         Insurance Counselors, Inc., to the United Insurance Counselors
         Corporation.  The Iowa Business Corporation Act requires an affirmative
         vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of the corporation to
         effectuate such amendment.  Although a quorum was present at each of
         these annual meetings, fifty per cent (50%) required to change the
         Articles of Incorporation were not represented, and the proposal could
         not be acted upon.

(b)      The general insurance agency and brokerage business was highly
         competitive.  Registrant competed locally and regionally with many
         direct-line writers of fire, casualty and surety insurance who were
         much larger than Registrant in all respects including premium volume,
         capital and personnel employed.  Registrant was also in competition
         with thousands of independent insurance agencies, some of whom had
         higher premium volume and more employees than Registrant.  Registrant
         was not a significant factor in the total volume of general insurance
         business.

         Registrant has sold Davenport agency to Ralph Parry Insurance Agency
         Ltd. in January 1981.

         (At the present time, the Registrant does not have any plans to acquire
         any insurance agencies.)

         At fiscal year end, Registrant, in its business has no employees.  The
         Trustee of the Frank B. Howes Trust which holds 36.5% of the
         outstanding common stock, Janice Howes died in July 1983, and John
         Howes became Trustee of the Frank B. Howes Trust.

         During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1980, the Viking Agency and
         the Hansen and Hansen, Inc. general insurance agencies, were sold on
         contract to R.A.P. Enterprises, Inc., Ralph A. Parry, former president
         of Registrant and the former manager of the Davenport agency owned by
         Registrant is the owner of R.A.P. Enterprises, Inc.

         During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, the Davenport
         agencies were sold to Ralph A. Parry Insurance Agency, Ltd., as of
         January 1, 1981.  Also owned by Ralph A. Parry.

         The intention at this time is to continue to loan on and invest in real
         estate properties and equities.

(c)      Line of Business

         The Registrant has not engaged in more than one line of business which
         meets the requisites of item 1 (c) (A), (B) or (C) for business with
         sales and revenues which do not exceed $50,000.00.

         Registrant and its subsidiaries are not engaged in material operations
         in foreign countries, nor does Registrant or its subsidiaries have a
         material portion of sales or revenues derived from customers in foreign
         countries.

ITEM 2.                    MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION FOR 9/30/06

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

Liquidity

        Registrant receives approximately $5,650 of cash each month from
payments of principal and interest on Real Estate Contracts Receivable.
Registrant has very little liquidity because most of these payments are used to
pay management fees and other operating expenses.

Capital Resources

        The principal assets of the registrant at September 30, 2006 are
fourteen real estate contracts receivable.

Results of Operations

        The loss from operations for the year ended September 30, 2006
decreased $45,746 compared to the year ended September 30, 2005.

        Total revenue increased $35,410.  This was primarily due to a
change in method of accounting for income recognition on installment contracts.
On October 1, 2005, the Company elected to adopt the provisions of FAS #66.
This change deferred $27,587 of income from the year ended September 30, 2005,
to future years.  All but $8,127 of that deferral was recognized in the year
ended September 30, 2006.

        Operating expenses decreased $10,336.  The decrease resulted from the
following:

        The Company utilizes the employees of a related entity.  For
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the Company paid the related
entity $17,623 for it's prorata share of wages and payroll tax costs. For the
year ended September 30, 2005, those payments were $23,148.

	Other operating expenses decreased $4,811.

Item 3.  Properties

         The Registrant has its offices at 2920 Harrison Street, Davenport,
         Iowa.  The Company rents approximately 700 square feet of space with
         furnishings at a monthly rate of $1,350 dollars.

         Registrant feels this office space is of adequate size and capacity to
         handle the business of Registrant and its anticipated growth for
         foreseeable future needs.

Item 4.  Parents and Subsidiaries of the Registrant

         The Frank B. Howes Trust, which holds 36.5 per cent of the Registrant's
         outstanding common stock, is the parent of the Registrant.  This
         percentage includes 3,000,000 shares which is held in escrow by the
         Insurance Department of Iowa.  The escrow arrangement was required by
         the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Iowa in order to gain
         approval of Registrant's new stock issue of April 1971.  Under the
         terms of this arrangement, those shares could not be sold for a period
         of five (5) years or until Registrant attained certain profitable
         operating goals for three (3) consecutive years.  The escrow
         arrangement also required that should Registrant dissolve during this
         period, the shares held in escrow will not participate in the assets of
         Registrant legally available for distribution until after there has
         been paid or irrevocable set aside for all other shares an amount equal
         to the other shares at the per offering price of $1.25, adjusted for
         stock splits and stock dividends.  As of April 6, 1976, five (5) years
         elapsed.

         The Insurance Department of Iowa, Securities Division has indicated
         that under the terms of the Escrow Agreement the approval of the
         Commissioner of Insurance was required.  The Insurance Department,
         reviewing the condition of the Registrant, did conclude that the
         requisite approval of the Commissioner would not be forthcoming at that
         time, and furthermore, that the Insurance Department will act as escrow
         agent for the shares of the Frank B. Howes Trust.

Item 5.  Legal Proceedings

None

Item 6.  Increases and Decreases in Outstanding Securities and Indebtedness

    (a)  In the fiscal year, Registrant has not issued any new shares or
         otherwise created additional outstanding securities; neither has it
         reduced outstanding securities by purchase or acquisition of treasury
         shares.  Therefore, there were 11,222,600 shares of Registrant's stock

Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors
Davenport, Iowa

We have audited the balance sheet of Hynes & Howes Insurance Counselors (an Iowa

of income, stockholers' equity, and cash flows for the years then ended.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hynes &
Howes Insurance Counselors, Inc. as of September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004,

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         Nature of operations:  The Company invests in real estate, primarily
         single family residences, which it then resells on contract.  The
         Company operates exclusively in the Quad City metropolitan area of
         Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois.  The Company has a concentration of
         credit risk, in that all of its creditors live and work in the Quad
         City area.

	 Change in Method of Accounting for Income Recognition on Installment
	 Contracts:  On October 1, 2005, the Company elected to change its
	 method of income recognition on installment contracts, to the
	 installment method, when the down payment by the purchaser was less
	 than 5%.  In all prior years, income was recognized in the year of
 	 sale on the accrual method.  The new method of accounting was adopted
	 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard #66, Accounting for
	 Sales of Real Estate, and comparative financial statements of prior
	 years have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively.

         Accounting Policies:  The books and records of the Company are
         maintained on the accrual basis of accounting.  Investments in
	 contracts receivable are stated at the collectible balance.  Earnings
	 per share are computed on the basis of weighted average number of
         common shares outstanding.  Cash and cash equivalents are considered
         to be any investment with an original maturity of three months or less.

         Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in
         conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
         management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
         amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
         and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
         reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
         Actual results could differ from those estimates.

         Other significant accounting policies are detailed in other Notes to
         Financial Statements.

Note 7 - Stock Held in Escrow

         At September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 there were 3,546,000 shares of the
         Company's common stock held in trust.  Those shares were owned by the
         Frank B. Howes Trust and by directors or former directors of the
         Company.  The Trust agreement was required by the Commissioner of
         Insurance of the State of Iowa in order to gain approval of the
         Company's stock issue of April, 1971.  Under terms of this agreement
         these shares were to be released after a period of five years or when
         the Company attains certain profitable goals for three consecutive
         years and upon written approval from the Commissioner of Insurance of
         the State of Iowa.  It is also required that should the Company
         dissolve during this period that the pro-rated distribution of assets
         to stockholders would be done on a basis which would pay these
         shareholders less per share than would be distributable to the
         shareholders of the new issue.  The Company's earnings to date have not
         been sufficient to qualify for the release of these shares held in
         escrow.  The condition requiring that these shares be held in escrow
         for five years has been fulfilled, however, the Commissioner of
         Insurance of the State of Iowa has not granted the written approval for
         the release of these shares at this time.  The shares will continue to
         be held in escrow until the Commisioner grants written approval for
         their release.

Note 8 - Contingent Liability for Rescission of Capital Stock Sales

         Since its inception, the Company has issued and sold 11,222,699 shares
         of its common stock.  Although most of these shares were registered
         with the State of Iowa, none of these shares were registered for sale
         under the federal securities law.  These shares were issued and sold in
         reliance either upon the exemption provided in Section 4 (2) or Section
         3 (a) (11) of the Securities Act of 1933.

         The Company feels that any possible shares and federal contingent
         liabilities that may have existed because of the issuance of securities
         which may not have been exempt from registration under the Securities
         Act of 1933 and unless the subject of an existing legal proceeding
         filed appropriately, may now be extinguished as a result of the new
         Iowa Uniform Securities Act which became effective on January 1, 1976
         under Section 613 of that Act, liability must now be ascertained by
         looking to the statute in effect at the time that the stock issue was
         sold.  The two year statute of limitations in effect on January 14,
         1973, at the time of the closing of the issue has run, as have the
         other applicable federal statutes of limitation. As a result, with
         the exception of the Federal and State Tolling Doctrines, possible
         contingent liabilities may no longer exist.

Note 9 - Contingent Liability on Pending Litigation

         On November 2, 1973, in U. S. District Court a Final Judgment of
         permanent Injunction was brought against the Company because of a
         complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The
         Injunction enjoins the Company from failing to file timely and proper
         reports as required by Section 12 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act
	 of 1934.  The Company is currently complying with filing requirements,
         however, it may be subject to subsequent court action and potential
         fine if there are future filing deficiencies.

         taxes has not been made.

	     in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
	     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
	     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
	     weaknesses.
