PART
      I 

Item
                1.  

Business  

(a) 

General
                development of business. 

Walgreen
      Co. (The "company" or "Walgreens") was incorporated as an Illinois corporation
      in 1909 as a successor to a business founded in 1901. Walgreens is the nation's
      largest drugstore chain (based on sales) and recorded its 32   nd   
      year of
      consecutive sales and earnings growth. During the year, the company opened
      or
      acquired 570 stores for a net increase of 476 stores after relocations and
      closings. The total number of stores at August 31, 2006 was 5,461 located in
      47
      states and Puerto Rico. Aggressive growth will continue as the company
      anticipates operating more than 7,000 stores by 2010. 

Walgreens
      is committed to organic growth but carefully considers unique acquisition
      opportunities when they are a good fit with the existing store base. In 2006,
      for example, the company merged with 76 Happy Harry's stores, primarily in
      Delaware. 

The
      company's managed care division, Walgreens Health Services, continues to grow
      organically, as well as through acquisitions. Three recent acquisitions include
      Schraft's A Specialty Pharmacy, for fertility drugs, Medmark Inc., a specialty
      pharmacy business and SeniorMed LLC, which supplies medications to assisted
      living and long-term care institutions. 

To
      support store expansion, the company opened four additional distribution centers
      in the past five years, the most recent in Moreno Valley, California in fiscal
      2004. These centers are 20% more productive than our older distribution centers.
      The first of a new-generation of distribution centers is scheduled to open
      in
      South Carolina in fiscal 2007. This center is expected to provide another 20%
      productivity improvement. A second new-generation center in Connecticut is
      planned to open in fiscal 2009.  

Prescription
      sales continue to become a larger portion of the company's business. This year
      prescriptions accounted for 64.3% of sales compared to 63.7% last year. Third
      party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations,
      government and private insurance, were 93.1% of prescription sales compared
      to
      92.7% a year ago. Overall, Walgreens filled 529 million prescriptions in 2006,
      an increase of 8.1% from the previous year.  

Walgreens
      pharmacy sales trends are expected to continue to grow due, in part, to the
      aging population, the introduction of lower priced generics and the continued
      development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control
      healthcare costs. Also, the increase in generic introductions continues to
      boost
      the number of prescriptions filled. Although generics reduce sales dollars,
      they
      save both patients and payors money and generally offer higher gross profit
      than
      brand name drugs. 

The
      company has garnered a larger share of senior patients from the Medicare Part
      D
      prescription drug benefit that rolled out on January 1, 2006. Of the Medicare
      Part D prescriptions filled in the first eight months of calendar 2006, more
      than 35% were for new patients introduced to Walgreens umbrella of pharmacy
      services for the first time. 

As
      of
      fiscal year-end 2006, 220 employers and managed care plans offer Advantage90,
      a
      90-day retail prescription option to mandatory mail programs, to a total of
      6.5
      million members. 

Photofinishing
      continued to contribute to gross margins for general merchandise in 2006, as
      the
      company expanded its digital photo offerings. New online digital photo services
      introduced in fiscal 2006 increased sales by 58%. Walgreens has also initiated
      a
      printer cartridge refill program in stores. 

Walgreens
      strong name recognition continues to drive private brand sales, which are now
      17% of the company's front-end business and 46% of all private brand sales
      in
      U.S. chain drugstores. 

-2- 

During
        fiscal 2006, Walgreens' market share in 58 of the top 60 front-end categories
        increased, as compared to all food, drug and mass merchandise competitors.
        Today, 131.8 million people live within two miles of a Walgreens and 4.7
        million
        shoppers walk into a Walgreens store daily.   

During
        fiscal year 2006 the company added $1.3 billion to property and equipment,
        which
        included approximately $1.039 billion related to stores, $162.7 million for
        distribution centers, and $135.8 million related to other corporate items.
        Capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 are expected to be approximately $1.7
        billion, excluding acquisitions.  

Walgreens
      plans to increase business by investing in prime locations, new technology
      and
      customer service initiatives in fiscal 2007. 

(b) 

Financial
                information about industry
                segments. 

The
      company's primary business is the operation of retail drugstores. 

(c) 

Narrative
                description of business. 

(i) 

Principal
                products produced and services
                rendered. 

The
      drugstores are engaged in the retail sale of prescription and non-prescription
      drugs and general merchandise. General merchandise includes, among other things,
      beauty care, personal care, household items, candy, photofinishing, greeting
      cards, seasonal items and convenience foods. Customers can have prescriptions
      filled at the drugstore counter as well as through the mail, by telephone and
      on
      the Internet. 

The
      estimated contributions of various product classes to sales for each of the
      last
      three fiscal years are as follows:  

(ii) 

Status
                of a product or segment. 

Not
      applicable. 

(iii) 

Sources
                and availability of raw materials. 

Inventories
      are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. The loss of any
      one
      supplier or group of suppliers under common control would not have a material
      effect on the business. 

(iv) 

Patents,
                trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions
                held. 

Walgreens
      markets products under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and
      holds
      assorted business licenses (pharmacy, occupational, liquor, etc.) having various
      lives, which are necessary for the normal operation of business. The company
      also has filed various patent applications relating to its business and
      products, six of which have been issued. 

-3- 

(v) 

Seasonal
                  variations in business. 

The
        business is seasonal in nature, with Christmas generating a higher proportion
        of
        front-end sales and earnings than other periods. Both prescription and
        non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the
        cold/flu season. See the note "Summary of Quarterly Results (Unaudited)"
        on page
        31 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended August 31, 2006
        ("2006 Annual Report"), which note is incorporated herein by
        reference. 

(vi) 

Working
                capital practices. 

The
      company generally finances its inventory and expansion needs with internally
      generated funds. See the note "Short-Term Borrowings" on page 29 and
      "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition" on pages 20
      through 22 of the 2006 Annual Report, which sections are incorporated herein
      by
      reference. Short-term borrowings are not expected in fiscal 2007. 

Due
      to
      the nature of the retail drugstore business 93.1% of all prescription sales
      are
      now covered by third party payors. Prescription sales represent 64.3% of total
      store sales. The remainder of store sales are principally for cash, credit
      and
      debit cards. Customer returns are immaterial. 

(vii) 

Dependence
                upon limited number of customers. 

Sales
      are
      to numerous customers which include various managed care organizations;
      therefore, the loss of any one customer or a group of customers under common
      control would not have a material effect on the business. No customer accounts
      for ten percent or more of the company's consolidated sales. 

(viii) 

Backlog
                orders. 

Not
      applicable. 

(ix) 

Government
                contracts. 

The
      company fills prescriptions for many state public assistance plans. Revenues
      from all such plans are approximately 6.5% of total sales. 

(x) 

Competitive
                conditions. 

The
      drug
      store industry is highly competitive. As a volume leader in the retail drug
      industry, Walgreens competes with various retailers, including chain and
      independent drugstores, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores,
      mass
      merchants and dollar stores. Competition remained keen during the fiscal year
      with the company competing on the basis of service, convenience, variety and
      price. The company's geographic dispersion tends to offset the impact of
      temporary economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. The number
      and location of the company's drugstores appear in the listing of stores by
      state on the back cover of the 2006 Annual Report, which section is incorporated
      herein by reference.  

(xi) 

Research
                and development activities. 

The
      company does not engage in any material research activities. 

-4- 

(xii) 

Environmental
                  disclosures. 

Federal,
        state and local environmental protection requirements have no material effect
        upon capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive position of the
        company. 

(xiii) 

Number
                  of employees. 

The
        company employs approximately 195,000 persons, about 52,800 of whom are
        part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. 

(d) 

Financial
                  information about foreign and domestic operations and export
                  sales. 

All
        the
        company sales occurred within the continental United States and Puerto Rico.
        There are no export sales. 

(e)

Cautionary
      Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements  

Certain
      information in this annual report, as well as in other public filings, the
      company website, press releases and oral statements made by our representatives,
      is forward-looking information based on current expectations and plans that
      involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking information includes statements
      concerning pharmacy sales trends, prescription margins, number and location
      of
      new store openings, outcomes of litigation, the level of capital expenditures,
      demographic trends; as well as those that include or are preceded by the words
      "expects," "estimates," "believes," "plans," "anticipates" or similar language.
      For such statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor provisions
      of
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  

Forward-looking
      statements may involve risks and uncertainties, known or unknown to the company,
      that could cause results to differ materially from management expectations
      as
      projected in such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties
      are
      discussed in Item 1A below. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities
      laws, the company assumes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements
      to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.

Item
        1A.          Risk
        Factors  

The
        risks
        described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
        condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that
        we
        face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors
        that
        are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial
        to
        our operations. 

The
      retail drug store and pharmacy benefit services industries are highly
      competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us.

We
      face
      intense competition with local, regional and national companies, including
      other
      drug store chains, independent drug stores, mail-order prescription providers
      and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass
      merchants and dollar stores, many of which are aggressively expanding in markets
      we serve. In the pharmacy benefit services industry, our competitors include
      large national and regional pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies
      and managed care providers, some of which are owned by or have affiliations
      with
      our retail drug store competitors. As competition increases in the markets
      in
      which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could
      occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain
      competitive. Our failure to reduce prices could result in decreased revenue,
      and
      reducing prices without also reducing costs could negatively affect profits.

Reductions
      in third-party reimbursement levels, from private or government plans, for
      prescription drugs could reduce our margin on pharmacy sales and could have
      a
      significant effect on our retail drug store profits.   

The
      continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care
      organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, government entities,
      and
      other third-party payors to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy
      reimbursement rates may impact our profitability.  On February 8, 2006, the
      President signed into law the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which seeks to
      reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula for
      multi-source (i.e., generic) drugs. These changes are expected to result in
      reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies. In addition, the
      President s proposed budget for fiscal year 2007 contains further reductions in
      the Medicaid reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs. We cannot determine
      the impact at this time. Reduced reimbursement rates could adversely affect
      our
      revenues and profits. 

We
      are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A
      significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have
      a
      material adverse effect on profitability.   

Our
      retail drug store and pharmacy benefit services businesses are subject to
      numerous federal, state and local regulations. Changes in these regulations
      may
      require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to
      implement. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations
      could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could
      adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including: suspension
      of payments from government programs; loss of required government
      certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from
      government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
      loss of licenses; or significant fines or monetary penalties, and could
      adversely affect the continued operation of our business.       The
      regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: federal,
      state and local registration and regulation of pharmacies; applicable Medicare
      and Medicaid regulations; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
      Act, or HIPAA; accounting standards; tax laws and regulations; laws and
      regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety
      matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal
      of, hazardous substances; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
      the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and
      the
      Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities,
      governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell;
      anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; and federal and state laws governing
      the
      practice of the profession of pharmacy. Furthermore, the frequency and rate
      of
      FDA approval of new brand name and generic prescription drugs or of additional
      existing prescription drugs for over-the-counter sales could have an impact
      on
      our revenues and profitability.

Our
        ability to hire and retain pharmacy personnel is important to the continued
        success of our business.   

As
        our
        business expands, we believe that our future success will depend greatly
        on our
        continued ability to attract and retain skilled and qualified pharmacists.
        The
        retail drug store industry is experiencing an ongoing shortage of licensed
        pharmacists. This has resulted in continued upward pressure on pharmacist
        compensation packages. Although we generally have been able to meet our
        pharmacist staffing requirements in the past, any future inability to do
        so
        could limit our ability to offer extended pharmacy hours and negatively impact
        our revenue and our ability to deliver high levels of customer service.

Should
      a product liability issue or personal injury issue arise, inadequate product
      or
      other liability insurance coverage or our inability to maintain such insurance
      may result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Products
      that we sell could become subject to contamination, product tampering,
      mislabeling or other damage. In addition, errors in the dispensing and packaging
      of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury. Product liability or personal
      injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products
      or
      pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Should a product or other
      liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and
      the
      indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us
      against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable
      terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product
      liability or personal injury issue or judgment against us or a product recall
      could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
      of
      operations. 

Our
      ability to grow our business may be constrained by our inability to find
      suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the expiration of our
      current leases.   

Our
      ability to grow our business may be constrained if suitable new store locations
      cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable
      to
      us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for
      our stores. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of
      stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations
      and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The expiration of leases
      at
      existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those
      leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores.
      Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely
      affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores.  

Changes
      in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices and
      reduce our revenues and profitability.   

Our
      performance may be negatively influenced by changes in national, regional or
      local economic conditions and consumer confidence. External factors that affect
      consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment
      rates, levels of personal disposable income, national, regional or local
      economic conditions, the introduction of new merchandise or brand and generic
      prescription drugs, and acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions
      and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing
      power and spending patterns. A decrease in overall consumer spending as a result
      of changes in economic conditions could adversely affect our front-end sales.
      Profit margins are greater on front-end sales than on pharmacy sales, and any
      decrease in sales of front-end products would have a negative impact on our
      profitability. Acts of war or terrorism may cause damage to our facilities,
      disrupt the supply of the products and services we offer in our stores or
      adversely impact consumer demand. All these factors could impact our revenues,
      operating results and financial condition. 

There
      are a number of business risks which could adversely affect our financial
      results.  

Our
      success depends on our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing
      and
      promotional programs. If we are unsuccessful in our advertising and
      merchandising strategies, sales could be negatively affected. Our success also
      depends on our continued ability to attract and retain store and management
      personnel, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the
      results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow. We also may not
      be
      able to successfully and timely implement new computer systems and technology,
      or may experience system disruptions or delays, which could adversely impact
      our
      operations and our ability to attract and retain customers. Furthermore, the
      products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international
      vendors, and any future inability to find qualified vendors and access products
      in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business.

      are planned; Anderson, South Carolina which is projected to open in fiscal
      2007
      and Windsor, Connecticut which is scheduled to open in fiscal 2009.

MANAGEMENT'S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  

        OF
      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION   

Introduction  

Walgreens
      is a retail drugstore chain that sells prescription and non-prescription drugs
      and general merchandise. General merchandise includes, among other things,
      beauty care, personal care, household items, candy, photofinishing, greeting
      cards, seasonal items and convenience food. Customers can have prescriptions
      filled at the drugstore counter, as well as through the mail, by telephone
      and
      on the Internet. As of August 31, 2006, we operated 5,461 stores (including
      three mail service facilities, 38 home care facilities, 18 clinic pharmacies
      and
      five specialty pharmacies) located in 47 states and Puerto Rico. 

The
      drugstore industry is highly competitive. In addition to other drugstore chains,
      independent drugstores and mail order prescription providers, we also compete
      with various other retailers including grocery stores, convenience stores,
      mass
      merchants and dollar stores. 

Prescription
      sales continue to become a larger portion of the company's business. The
      long-term outlook for prescription sales is strong due in part to the aging
      population, the introduction of lower priced generics and the continued
      development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control
      healthcare costs. As of January 1, 2006, the Medicare Part D prescription drug
      program went into effect. This program has resulted in additional prescription
      sales, although the gross margin rates on these sales have been lower. The
      Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 becomes effective during fiscal 2007, and is
      expected to reduce our reimbursement for Medicaid generic drugs.  

Front-end
      sales have continued to grow due to strengthening core categories and new
      businesses such as digital photo services and the introduction of our new inkjet
      printer cartridge refill program. Walgreen private brand sales now comprise
      17%
      of front-end sales. 

We
      continue to expand into new markets and increase penetration in existing
      markets. To support our growth, we are investing significantly in prime
      locations, technology and customer service initiatives. Organic growth continues
      to be our primary growth vehicle; however, consideration is given to
      acquisitions that provide a unique opportunity and strategic fit. In fiscal
      2006, for example, we merged with Happy Harry's, a drugstore chain with 76
      locations, primarily in Delaware. Our managed care division continues to grow
      organically, as well as through acquisitions. Three recent acquisitions include
      Schraft's A Specialty Pharmacy, for infertility drugs; Medmark Inc., a specialty
      pharmacy business; and SeniorMed LLC, which supplies medications to assisted
      living and long-term care institutions. 

Operating
      Statistics  

-3- 

Results
      of Operations  

Fiscal
      2006 was our 32nd consecutive year of record sales and earnings. Fiscal year
      net
      earnings increased 12.3% to $1.751 billion, or $1.72 per share (diluted), versus
      last year's earnings of $1.560 billion, or $1.52 per share (diluted). Net
      earnings increases resulted from improved sales with lower expense ratios,
      partially offset by lower gross profit margins.  

This
      year's results included a $102.5 million pre-tax or $.06 per share (diluted)
      charge related to the first quarter adoption of Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payments," which requires
      expensing stock options based on the fair value of those options at the date
      of
      the grant. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the company recorded
      $54.7
      million ($.03 per share, diluted) of pre-tax expenses related to Hurricane
      Katrina, which hit the Gulf Coast area in late August. These estimates were
      revised downward by $12.3 million in fiscal year 2006. Fiscal 2006 also included
      pre-tax litigation settlement gains of $7.3 million (less than $.01 per share,
      diluted) compared to similar settlements of $26.3 million ($.02 per share,
      diluted) in fiscal 2005 and $16.3 million ($.01 per share, diluted) in fiscal
      2004. 

Net
      sales
      increased by 12.3% to $47.409 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to increases
      of
      12.5% in 2005 and 15.4% in 2004. Drugstore sales increases resulted from sales
      gains in existing stores and added sales from new stores, each of which includes
      an indeterminate amount of market-driven price changes. Sales in comparable
      drugstores were up 7.7% in 2006, 8.2% in 2005 and 10.9% in 2004. Comparable
      drugstores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve
      consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and
      without a major remodel or a natural disaster in the past twelve months.
      Relocated stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve
      months after the relocation. The company operated 5,461 stores at August 31,
      2006, compared to 4,985 at August 31, 2005 and 4,613 at August 31, 2004.

Prescription
      sales increased 13.3% in 2006, 13.4% in 2005 and 17.8% in 2004. Comparable
      drugstore prescription sales were up 9.2% in 2006, 9.8% in 2005 and 14.0% in
      2004. Prescription sales were 64.3% of total net sales for fiscal 2006 compared
      to 63.7% in 2005 and 63.2% in 2004. The effect of generic drugs, which have
      a
      lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by
      2.0% for 2006, 2.4% for 2005 and 1.2% for 2004. Third party sales, where
      reimbursement is received from managed care organizations as well as government
      and private insurance, were 93.1% of pharmacy sales in 2006, 92.7% in 2005
      and
      91.7% in 2004. The total number of prescriptions filled for fiscal 2006 was
      approximately 529 million; 489 million in fiscal 2005 and 442 million in fiscal
      2004. 

Front-end
      sales increased 10.9% in 2006, 11.1% in 2005 and 11.7% in 2004. Front-end sales
      were 35.6% of total sales in fiscal 2006, 36.1% in 2005 and 36.5% in 2004.
      Comparable front-end sales increased 5.3% in 2006, 5.5% in 2005 and 6.1% in
      2004. 

-4- 

Gross
      margins as a percent of total net sales were 27.8% in 2006, 27.9% in 2005 and
      27.2% in 2004. The growth in the Walgreens Health Services portion of the
      business, with lower gross margins than drugstores, negatively affected gross
      profit percents. Pharmacy margins decreased, in part, due to lower gross margin
      on Medicare Part D prescription sales. This was largely offset by higher generic
      drug utilization, which was aided by the steady stream of new generics over
      the
      past year. The continuing shift in sales mix toward prescriptions, which carry
      a
      lower margin than front-end merchandise, and growth in third party sales, which
      typically have lower profit margins than cash prescriptions, continue to
      adversely affect gross profit margins. Front-end margins were slightly higher
      for the year. 

We
      use
      the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory valuation. The LIFO provision
      is dependent upon inventory levels, inflation rates and merchandise mix. The
      effective LIFO inflation rates were 1.53% in 2006, 1.26% in 2005 and .14% in
      2004, which resulted in charges to cost of sales of $95.3 million in 2006,
      $67.8
      million in 2005 and $6.7 million in 2004. Inflation on prescription inventory
      was 2.37% in 2006, 2.18% in 2005 and .72% in 2004. In all three fiscal years,
      we
      experienced deflation in some non-prescription inventories. 

Selling,
      occupancy and administration expenses were 22.1% of sales in fiscal 2006, 22.2%
      in fiscal 2005 and 21.5% in fiscal 2004. The decrease in fiscal 2006 resulted
      from a $12.3 million adjustment lowering last fiscal year's $54.7 million
      pre-tax expense associated with Hurricane Katrina. Also affecting the fiscal
      2006 decrease were lower costs incurred as a result of the conversion from
      analog to digital photo labs. These decreases were partially offset by the
      fiscal 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), which requires the expensing of stock
      options. Fiscal 2005 was also affected by higher store salaries. Lower sales
      as
      a result of new generic drugs also increased expense ratios during the
      periods. 

Interest
      income increased in 2006 due to higher interest rates. Average net investment
      levels were approximately $1.225 billion in 2006, $1.307 billion in 2005 and
      $1.281 billion in 2004. 

The
      effective income tax rate was 36.4% for fiscal 2006, 36.5% for 2005 and 37.5%
      for 2004. Both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 rates were affected, in part, by
      the
      settlement of prior years' Internal Revenue Service matters. All tax years
      prior
      to fiscal 2004 have been finalized with the Internal Revenue Service. Fiscal
      2005 was also affected by foreign tax credit adjustments. 

Critical
      Accounting Policies  

The
      consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include
      amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results
      may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable
      deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact
      on
      our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent
      that
      the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the
      statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be
      necessary. These adjustments would be made in future statements. Some of the
      more significant estimates include liability for closed locations, liability
      for
      insurance claims, vendor allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts and cost
      of
      sales. We use the following techniques to determine our estimates: 

Liability
      for closed locations -  

      The
      liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other
      related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date.
      We have not made any material changes to the method of estimating our liability
      for closed locations during the last three years. Based on current knowledge,
      we
      do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material
      change in the estimate or assumptions used to determine the
      liability. 

-5- 

Liability
      for insurance claims - 

      The
      liability for insurance claims is recorded based on estimates for claims
      incurred. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims
      experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. We have not
      made any material changes to the method of estimating our liability for
      insurance claims during the last three years. Based on current knowledge, we
      do
      not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material
      change in the estimate or assumptions used to determine the
      liability. 

      Vendor
      allowances -  

      Vendor
      allowances are principally received as a result of purchase levels, sales or
      promotion of vendors' products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction
      of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related
      merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors' products
      are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling,
      occupancy and administration expense to the extent of advertising incurred,
      with
      the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. We have not made any
      material changes to the method of estimating our vendor allowances during the
      last three years. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a
      reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimate
      or
      assumptions used to determine vendor allowances. 

      Allowance
      for doubtful accounts - 

      The
      provision for bad debt is based on both specific receivables and historic
      write-off percentages. We have not made any material changes to the method
      of
      estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts during the last three years.
      Based on current knowledge, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood
      that there will be a material change in the estimate or assumptions used to
      determine the allowance. 

      Cost
      of
      sales - 

      Drugstore
      cost of sales is primarily derived based on point-of-sale scanning information
      with an estimate for shrinkage and adjusted based on periodic inventories.
      We
      have not made any material changes to the method of estimating cost of sales
      during the last three years. Based on current knowledge, we do not believe
      there
      is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimate
      or assumptions used to determine cost of sales. 

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources  

Cash
      and
      cash equivalents were $919.9 million at August 31, 2006, compared to $576.8
      million at August 31, 2005. Short-term investment objectives are to minimize
      risk, maintain liquidity and maximize after-tax yields. To attain these
      objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of
      securities. Investments are principally in top-tier money market funds and
      commercial paper. 

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities was $2.440 billion in fiscal 2006 and $1.371
      billion in fiscal 2005. The change between periods was primarily caused by
      increased net earnings and better inventory control. The increase in accounts
      receivable, as well as the increase in trade accounts payable, were both driven
      by growth in our pharmacy benefit management business under the Medicare Part
      D
      prescription plan. Our profitability is the principal source of funds for
      expansion, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to shareholders and
      the
      stock repurchase program. 

Net
      cash
      used for investing activities was $1.684 billion versus $434.0 million last
      year. Proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities exceeded purchases
      of
      such securities by $106.0 million in fiscal 2006 compared to $777.9 million
      in
      fiscal 2005. We actively invest in municipal bonds and student obligations
      and
      purchase these securities at par. While the underlying security is issued as
      a
      long-term investment, they typically can be purchased and sold every 7, 28
      and
      35 days. The trading of auction rate securities takes place through a descending
      price auction with the interest rate reset at the beginning of each holding
      period. At the end of each holding period the interest is paid to the investor.

Additions
      to property and equipment were $1.338 billion compared to $1.238 billion last
      year. In total there were 570 new or relocated locations (net 476) in fiscal
      2006. This compared to 440 last year (net 372). New stores are owned or leased.
      There were 136 owned locations added during the year and 62 under construction
      at August 31, 2006, versus 103 owned locations added and 96 under construction
      as of August 31, 2005. Business acquisitions include Schraft's A Specialty
      Pharmacy, which provides fertility medications and services; Medmark Inc.,
      which
      provides pharmacy care to patients with unique or chronic medication needs;
      SeniorMed LLC, an institutional pharmacy, which provides prescription services
      to assisted living communities; Home Pharmacy of California and Canadian Valley
      Medical Solutions, which provide home care services; and selected assets from
      the 23-store Medic drugstore chain in the Cleveland market. A merger with
      Delaware-based Happy Harry's pharmacy chain included all 76 Happy Harry's stores
      in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, along with the corporate
      office and distribution center in Newark, Delaware. 

Capital
      expenditures for fiscal 2007 are expected to be approximately $1.7 billion,
      excluding business acquisitions. We expect to open approximately 500 new stores
      in fiscal 2007, with a net increase of more than 400 stores, and anticipate
      having a total of 7,000 stores by the year 2010. We are continuing to relocate
      stores to more convenient and profitable freestanding locations. In addition
      to
      new stores, expenditures are planned for distribution centers and technology.
      Two new distribution centers are scheduled: one in Anderson, South Carolina,
      with an anticipated opening date in fiscal 2007 and another in Windsor,
      Connecticut, with an anticipated opening date in fiscal 2009. 

Net
      cash
      used for financing activities was $413.0 million compared to $804.4 million
      last
      year. On July 14, 2004, the Board of Directors announced a stock repurchase
      program of up to $1 billion, which we plan to execute over four years. During
      fiscal 2006 we purchased $289.7 million of company shares related to the stock
      repurchase program for a total of $656.8 million in purchases since the start
      of
      the program. An additional $379.1 million of shares were purchased to support
      the long-term needs of the employee stock plans. Comparable amounts were $345.1
      million and $436.7 million in fiscal 2005. Cash dividends paid were $262.9
      million for fiscal 2006 versus $214.5 million last year. A $213.9 million wire
      transfer made on August 31, 2006, was not accepted by our disbursement bank
      until September 1, resulting in a bank overdraft at fiscal year-end. There
      were
      no new short-term borrowings during either period. At August 31, 2006, we had
      a
      syndicated bank line of credit facility of $200 million to support our
      short-term commercial paper program.  

Our
      credit ratings as of August 31, 2006, were as follows: 

Rating
                Agency 

Rating 

Outlook 

Moody's 

Aa3 

Negative 

Standard
                  Poor's 

A+ 

Stable 

In
      assessing our credit strength, both Moody's and Standard   Poor's consider
      our business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial
      statements. Our credit ratings impact our future borrowing costs, access to
      capital markets and future operating lease costs.

                  are
                  enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant
                  terms,
                  including open purchase
                  orders. 

Off-Balance
      Sheet Arrangements  

Letters
      of credit are issued to support purchase obligations and commitments (as
      reflected on the Contractual Obligations and Commitments table) as follows
      (In
      Millions): 

We
      have
      no other off-balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed on the
      previous Contractual Obligations and Commitments table. 

Both
      on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financing are considered when targeting
      debt to equity ratios to balance the interests of equity and debt (real estate)
      investors. This balance allows us to lower our cost of capital while maintaining
      a prudent level of financial risk. 

Recent
      Accounting Pronouncements  

In
      March
      2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Financial
      Interpretation (FIN) 47, "Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
      Obligations," which became effective in our fourth quarter fiscal 2006. This
      interpretation clarifies that the term    conditional
      asset retirement obligation   
      as used
      in FASB SFAS No. 143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement
      activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on
      a
      future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. We have
      adopted this interpretation and have determined that there is no impact on
      our
      financial statements. 

-8- 

In
      May
      2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,"
      which will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This statement
      addresses the retrospective application of such changes and corrections and
      will
      be followed if and when necessary. 

In
      November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) 123(R)-3, "Transition
      Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
      Awards." This pronouncement provides an alternative transition method of
      calculating the excess tax benefits available to absorb any tax deficiencies
      recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The company has
      elected to adopt the alternative transition method. 

In
      June
      2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-3, "How
      Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should
      Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)."
      This pronouncement will be effective third quarter of fiscal 2007. 

      The
      task
      force reached a conclusion that either method is acceptable, however, if taxes
      are reported on a gross basis (included as sales) a company should disclose
      those amounts if significant. Sales taxes are not included in revenues; however,
      we are still evaluating the impact of this pronouncement on other
      taxes. 

In
      July
      2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -
      an
      interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." This interpretation clarifies the
      accounting and disclosure for uncertain income tax positions, which relate
      to
      the uncertainty about how certain income tax positions should be reflected
      in
      the financial statements before they are resolved with the tax authorities.
      This
      interpretation will be effective first quarter of fiscal 2008. We are currently
      reviewing this pronouncement to determine the impact that it may have on our
      consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This
      statement defines and provides guidance when applying fair value measurements
      to
      accounting pronouncements that require or permit such measurements. This
      statement which will be effective first quarter of fiscal 2009, is not expected
      to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results
      of
      operations. 

In
      September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff
      Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108. This SAB addresses diversity in practice
      in
      quantifying financial statement misstatements. It also addresses the facts
      to
      consider when evaluating the materiality of the error and the need to restate
      the financial statements. This interpretation is effective for our first quarter
      of fiscal 2007 and will be followed if and when necessary. 

In
      October 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined
      Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans." Companies will be required
      to
      reflect the plan s funded status on the balance sheet. The difference between
      the plan s funded status and its current balance sheet position would be
      recognized, net of tax, as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive
      Income. Had this statement been effective as of August 31, 2006, the impact
      to
      Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income would have been $39.9 million. This
      pronouncement will be effective for the company's fourth quarter of fiscal
      2007.

Summary
      of Major Accounting Policies  

       Description
      of Business  

The
      company is principally in the retail drugstore business and its operations
      are
      within one reportable segment. At August 31, 2006, there were 5,461 stores,
      located in 47 states and Puerto Rico. Prescription sales were 64.3% of total
      sales for fiscal 2006 compared to 63.7% in 2005 and 63.2% in 2004. 

Basis
      of Presentation  

The
      consolidated statements include the accounts of the company and its
      subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
      The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include
      amounts based on management's prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results
      may differ from these estimates. 

Cash
      and Cash Equivalents  

Cash
      and
      cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with
      an
      original maturity of three months or less. Included in cash and cash equivalents
      are credit card and debit card receivables from banks, which settle within
      two
      business days, of $54.7 million at August 31, 2006, and $55.4 million at August
      31, 2005. The company's cash management policy provides for controlled
      disbursement. As a result, the company maintains overdraft positions at certain
      banks. Such overdrafts, which were $575.3 million as of August 31, 2006, and
      $339.4 million as of August 31, 2005, are included in trade accounts payable
      in
      the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  

Short-Term
      Investments - Available for Sale  

The
      company's short-term investments - available for sale are principally auction
      rate securities. The company invests in municipal bonds and student obligations
      and purchases these securities at par. The underlying security is issued as
      a
      long-term investment. However, auction rate securities are classified as
      short-term investments because they typically can be purchased and sold every
      7,
      28 and 35 days. The trading of auction rate securities takes place through
      a
      descending price auction with the interest rate reset at the beginning of each
      holding period. At the end of each holding period the interest is paid to the
      investor. The unrealized gains on these securities at August 31, 2006 and 2005,
      were not significant. 

Financial
      Instruments  

The
      company had $105.1 million and $66.2 million of outstanding letters of credit
      at
      August 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which guarantee foreign trade purchases.
      Additional outstanding letters of credit of $282.2 million and $313.8 million
      at
      August 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, guarantee payments of casualty claims.
      The casualty claim letters of credit are annually renewable and will remain
      in
      place until the casualty claims are paid in full. Letters of credit of $1.7
      million were outstanding at both August 31, 2006 and 2005, to guarantee
      performance of construction contracts. The company pays a nominal facility
      fee
      to the financing bank to keep these letters of credit active. The company also
      had purchase commitments of approximately $782.8 million and $437.6 million
      at
      August 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the purchase of store
      locations and distribution centers. There were no investments in derivative
      financial instruments during fiscal 2006 and 2005.

Inventories  

Inventories
      are valued on a lower of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market basis. At
      August 31, 2006 and 2005, inventories would have been greater by $899.5 million
      and $804.2 million, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of
      first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market basis. Inventory includes product
      cost
      and inbound freight. Cost of sales is primarily derived based upon point-of-sale
      scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on
      periodic inventories. In addition to merchandise cost, cost of sales includes
      warehousing costs, purchasing costs, freight costs and vendor allowances not
      included as a reduction of advertising expense. 

Vendor
      Allowances  

Vendor
      allowances are principally received as a result of purchase levels, sales or
      promotion of vendors' products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction
      of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related
      merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors' products
      are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling,
      occupancy and administration expenses to the extent of advertising costs
      incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.

Property
      and Equipment  

Depreciation
      is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned
      assets. Leasehold improvements and leased properties under capital leases are
      amortized over the estimated physical life of the property or over the term
      of
      the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives range from 12 1/2 to
      39
      years for land improvements, buildings and building improvements and 3 to 12
      1/2
      years for equipment. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset,
      are capitalized in the property and equipment accounts. Routine maintenance
      and
      repairs are charged against earnings. The composite method of depreciation
      is
      used for equipment; therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other
      disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating
      location is closed, completely remodeled or impaired. Fully depreciated property
      and equipment are removed from the cost and related accumulated depreciation
      and
      amortization accounts. Property and equipment consists of (In

The
      company capitalizes application stage development costs for significant
      internally developed software projects, including "SIMS Plus," a strategic
      inventory management system, and "Ad Planning," an advertising system. These
      costs are amortized over a five-year period. Amortization was $24.2 million
      in
      2006, $20.4 million in 2005 and $19.0 million in 2004. Unamortized costs as
      of
      August 31, 2006 and 2005, were $109.6 million and $90.1 million, respectively.

Revenue
      Recognition  

The
      company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the
      merchandise. Customer returns are immaterial. 

Impaired
      Assets and Liabilities for Store Closings  

The
      company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances
      indicate. Store locations that have been open at least five years are reviewed
      for impairment indicators at least annually. Once identified, the amount of
      the
      impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the
      fair
      value, which is based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Included
      in
      selling, occupancy and administration expense were impairment charges of $22.1
      million in 2006, $14.5 million in 2005 and $9.2 million in 2004. 

The
      company also provides for future costs related to closed locations. The
      liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other
      related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date.

Insurance  

The
      company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those
      risks required by law to be insured. It is the company's policy to retain a
      significant portion of certain losses related to workers' compensation; property
      losses, as well as business interruption relating from such losses; and
      comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability. Provisions for these
      losses are recorded based upon the company's estimates for claims incurred.
      The
      provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience,
      demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.  

Pre-Opening
      Expenses  

Non-capital
      expenditures incurred prior to the opening of a new or remodeled store are
      expensed as incurred. 

Advertising
      Costs  

Advertising
      costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as
      incurred. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, occupancy
      and
      administration expense, were $306.9 million in 2006, $260.3 million in 2005
      and
      $230.9 million in 2004. Included in net advertising expenses were vendor
      advertising allowances of $174.8 million in 2006, $180.2 million in 2005 and
      $163.6 million in 2004.

Stock-Based
      Compensation Plans  

As
      of
      September 1, 2005, the company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
      Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," using the modified
      prospective transition method. Under this method, compensation expense is
      recognized for new grants beginning this fiscal year and any unvested grants
      prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). The company recognizes compensation
      expense on a straight-line basis over the employee's vesting period or to the
      employee's retirement eligible date, if earlier. In accordance with the modified
      prospective transition method, the financial statements for prior periods have
      not been restated.  

Prior
      to
      September 1, 2005, as permitted under SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
      Compensation," the company applied Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion
      No.
      25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based compensation
      plans. Under APB Opinion No. 25, compensation expense was recognized for stock
      option grants if the exercise price was below the fair value of the underlying
      stock at the measurement date.  

As
      a
      result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R), our earnings before income tax expense
      and
      net earnings for the fiscal year-end were $102.5 million and $59.3 million
      lower, respectively, than if the stock-based compensation was still accounted
      for under APB Opinion No. 25. The recognized tax benefit was $36.7 million.

As
      of
      August 31, 2006, there was $46.9 million of total unrecognized compensation
      cost
      related to nonvested awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a
      weighted average of 1.56 years.  

Prior
      to
      fiscal 2006, the company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting
      from
      the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated
      Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires excess tax benefits, the
      cash
      flow resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
      recognized for those options, to be classified as financing cash flows. The
      total excess tax benefit for fiscal 2006 was $56.5 million. 

Had
      compensation costs been determined consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123
      for options granted in fiscal 2005 and 2004, pro forma net earnings and net
      earnings per common share would have been as illustrated in the following table
      (In Millions, except per share amounts): 

Income
      Taxes  

The
      company provides for federal and state income taxes on items included in the
      Consolidated Statements of Earnings regardless of the period when such taxes
      are
      payable. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between
      financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and
      rates. 

-16- 

Earnings
      Per Share  

The
      dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated
      using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded
      from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the market
      price of the common shares. At August 31, 2006, and August 31, 2004, outstanding
      options to purchase 3,505,834 and 2,902,996 common shares were excluded from
      fiscal year 2006 and 2004 calculations, respectively. There were no
      anti-dilutive shares related to stock options in fiscal 2005.  

Interest
      Expense  

The
      company capitalized $3.3 million, $4.2 million and $1.1 million of interest
      expense as part of significant construction projects during fiscal 2006, 2005
      and 2004, respectively. Fiscal 2006 had no interest paid, net of amounts
      capitalized, compared to $.8 million in 2005 and $.2 million in
      2004.

Notes
      to Consolidated Financial Statements  

Hurricane
      Katrina  

In
      fiscal
      2005, the company provided for $54.7 million of pre-tax expenses related to
      Hurricane Katrina. During fiscal 2006, the company recorded a $12.3 million
      downward adjustment of the Hurricane Katrina expenses. 

Leases  

The
      company owns 18.3% of its locations; the remaining locations are leased
      premises. Initial terms are typically 20 to 25 years, followed by additional
      terms containing cancellation options at five-year intervals, and may include
      rent escalation clauses. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier
      of the date the company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or
      the
      date the company has the right to control the property. Additionally, the
      company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
      lease. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, most leases provide for contingent
      rentals based upon a portion of sales. 

Minimum
      rental commitments at August 31, 2006, under all leases having an initial or
      remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below (In
      Millions): 

The
      above
      minimum lease payments include minimum rental commitments related to capital
      leases of $69.5 million at August 31, 2006. This capital lease amount includes
      $31.7 million of executory costs and imputed interest. Total minimum lease
      payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of approximately
      $43.5 million on leases due in the future under non-cancelable
      subleases. 

The
      company remains secondarily liable on 22 assigned leases. The maximum potential
      of undiscounted future payments is $6.7 million as of August 31, 2006. Lease
      option dates vary, with some extending to 2014.

The
      company completed a merger with Happy Harry s, a drugstore chain, on July 1,
      2006. In addition, the company acquired 100% ownership of Schraft s and Medmark,
      both of which are specialty pharmacies, on November 3, 2005 and August 1, 2006,
      respectively. These business acquisitions have been included in the company's
      operating statements since their respective acquisition dates. Happy Harry s
      will add to the company s drugstore presence in the Northeast while Schraft's
      and Medmark are part of the expansion into the specialty pharmacy industry.

The
      aggregate purchase price of all business acquisitions was $485.4 million. These
      acquisitions added $137.1 million to prescription files, $55.0 million to
      purchasing and payor contracts, $31.3 million to trade names, $4.4 million
      to
      other amortizable intangibles and $158.1 million to goodwill ($21.3 million
      is
      expected to be deductible for tax purposes). The remaining fair value relates
      to
      tangible assets. Pro forma results of operations of the company for fiscal
      years
      2006, 2005 and 2004 would not be materially different as a result of these
      acquisitions and are therefore not presented. 

Amortization
      expense for intangible assets was $45.6 million in 2006, $18.5 million in 2005
      and $8.8 million in 2004. The weighted-average amortization period for purchased
      prescription files was five years for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005. The
      weighted-average amortization period for purchasing and payor contracts and
      trade names was ten years in fiscal 2006. The weighted-average amortization
      period for other intangible assets was nine years for fiscal 2006 and eleven
      years for fiscal 2005. Goodwill is evaluated annually during the fourth quarter
      of the company's fiscal year. No impairment loss related to goodwill occurred
      in
      either fiscal 2006 or fiscal 2005. 

Expected
      amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at August 31, 2006, is
      as
      follows (In Millions):

      taxes paid were $1.111 billion, $928.2 million and $734.1 million during the
      fiscal years ended August 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The difference
      between the statutory income tax rate and the effective tax rate is principally
      due to state income tax provisions. 

Short-Term
      Borrowings  

The
      company had no short-term borrowings in fiscal 2006 or 2005. At August 31,
      2006,
      the company had a syndicated bank line of credit facility of $200 million to
      support the company's short-term commercial paper program. The company pays
      a
      nominal facility fee to the financing bank to keep this line of credit facility
      active. 

Contingencies  

The
      company is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to the normal course
      of business and is subject to various investigations, inspections, audits,
      inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities responsible for
      enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject. These
      include a lawsuit for which a $31 million judgment was entered against the
      company in October 2006. The company has appealed the judgment and management
      is
      of the opinion, based upon the advice of General Counsel, that although the
      outcome of this and other litigation and investigations cannot be forecast
      with
      certainty, the final disposition should not have a material adverse effect
      on
      the company's consolidated financial position or results of
      operations. 

Capital
      Stock  

On
      July
      14, 2004, the Board of Directors announced a stock repurchase program of up
      to
      $1 billion, which is expected to be executed over four years. During fiscal
      2006, the company purchased $289.7 million of shares related to the stock
      repurchase program, which compares to $345.1 million of shares purchased in
      fiscal 2005. Total purchases to date related to the stock repurchase program
      have been $656.8 million. An additional $379.1 million of shares were purchased
      to support the long-term needs of the employee stock plans, which compares
      to
      $436.7 million in fiscal 2005. 

At
      August
      31, 2006, 86,104,397 shares of common stock were reserved for future stock
      issuances under the company's various employee benefit plans.

The
      Walgreen Co. Nonemployee Director Stock Plan provides that each nonemployee
      director receives an equity grant of shares each year on November 1. Through
      fiscal 2006, the plan determined the number of shares granted by dividing
      $80,000 by the price of a share of common stock on November 1. Beginning with
      the annual share grant made on November 1, 2006, the dollar value of the grant
      has increased to $100,000, and each nonemployee director may elect to receive
      this annual share grant in the form of shares or deferred stock units. During
      the term of the Plan, each nonemployee director will also receive 50% of his
      or
      her quarterly retainer in the form of shares, which may be deferred into an
      equal number of stock units. In addition, a nonemployee director may elect
      to
      defer all or a portion of the cash component of his or her quarterly retainer,
      meeting fees and committee chair retainer in the form of deferred stock units
      or
      to have such amounts placed in a deferred cash compensation account. Each
      nonemployee director received a grant of 1,771 shares in 2006, excluding any
      new
      directors which were prorated. Each nonemployee director received a grant of
      2,211 shares in 2005 and 2,298 shares in 2004.  

A
      summary
      of information relative to the company's stock option plans
      follows: 

The
      intrinsic value for options exercised in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $173.0
      million, $89.3 million and $132.0 million, respectively. The total fair value
      of
      options vested in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $116.3 million, $31.5 million
      and $36.1 million, respectively.

      received from the exercise of options in fiscal 2006 was $176.7 million. The
      related tax benefit realized was $66.1 million. The company has a practice
      of
      repurchasing shares on the open market to satisfy share-based payment
      arrangements and expects to repurchase approximately eight million shares during
      fiscal 2007. 

A
      summary
      of information relative to the company's restricted stock awards
      follows: 

-22- 

The
      fair
      value of each option grant was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing
      model with weighted-average assumptions used in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
      2004: 

(1) 

Represents
                    the Treasury bill rate for the expected term of the
                    option. 

(2) 

Represents
                    the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
                    The company analyzed separate groups of employees with similar
                    exercise
                    behavior to determine the expected term. 

(3) 

Based
                    on historical volatility of the company s common stock. 

(4) 

Represents
                    the company s cash dividend for the expected
                    term. 

Retirement
      Benefits  

The
      principal retirement plan for employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing
      Retirement Trust to which both the company and the employees contribute. The
      company's contribution, which is determined annually at the discretion of the
      Board of Directors, has historically related to pre-tax income. The
      profit-sharing provision was $245.0 million in 2006, $218.5 million in 2005
      and
      $193.6 million in 2004. The company's contributions were $216.1 million for
      2006, $262.3 million for 2005 and $161.5 million for 2004. 

The
      company provides certain health insurance benefits for retired employees who
      meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of
      hire.
      The costs of these benefits are accrued over the period earned. The company's
      postretirement health benefit plans are not funded.

Management's
      Report on Internal Control  

Our
      management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
      control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
      13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
      including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
      we
      conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
      financial reporting based on the framework in    Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework    issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      Based on our evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over
      financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2006. Our management's
      assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
      as of August 31, 2006, has been audited by Deloitte   Touche LLP, an
      independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which
      is
      included herein.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreen Co.: 

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreen Co. and
      Subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of August 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
      consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
      each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2006.  These
      financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
      on our audits. 

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that
      we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
      the
      financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
      examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
      in
      the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
      principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
      evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
      our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
      our
      opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
      respects, the financial position of Walgreen Co. and Subsidiaries as of August
      31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
      for
      each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2006, in conformity
      with
      accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

As
      discussed in "Summary of Major Accounting Policies" in the consolidated
      financial statements, effective September 1, 2005, the Company changed its
      method of accounting for share-based payments to adopt Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 123(R),    Share-Based
      Payment   . 

We
      have
      also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company's internal
      control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2006, based on the criteria
      established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework   
      issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and
      our
      report dated October 31, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management's
      assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
      reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
      internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To
      the
      Board of Directors and Shareholders of Walgreen Co.: 

We
      have
      audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management s
      Report on Internal Control, that Walgreen Co. and Subsidiaries (the  Company )
      maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of August
      31,
      2006, based on criteria established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework    issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The
      Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
      over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
      control over financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
      Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
      audit. 

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that
      we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
      effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
      material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
      internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment,
      testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
      control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
      the
      circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for
      our opinions. 

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
      or
      under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
      financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
      the
      company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
      preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control
      over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements. 

Because
      of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
      including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
      controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
      or
      detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the
      effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
      are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
      changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
      procedures may deteriorate.  

In
      our
      opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
      control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in
      all
      material respects, based on the criteria established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework    issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Also
      in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2006, based on the
      criteria established in    Internal
      Control Integrated Framework    issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
      Commission. 

We
      have
      also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of
      and
      for the year ended August 31, 2006 of the Company and our report dated October
      31, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
      included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company s change effective
      September 1, 2005, in its method of accounting for share-based
      payments.
