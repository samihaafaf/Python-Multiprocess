FORWARD-LOOKING
        STATEMENTS  

        This
        Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are  forward-looking
        statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
        amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
        All
        statements contained in this Form 10-K, other than statements of historical
        facts, are  forward-looking statements  for purposes of these provisions,
        including any statements regarding: 

future
        operating results; 

              future
        capital expenditures; 

              future
        debt, including liquidity and the sources and availability of funds related
        to
        debt; 

              future
        sales of assets and the gains or losses that may be recognized as a result
        of
        any such sale; and 

              continued
        compliance with the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility. 

In
        some
        cases, investors can identify these statements by forward-looking words such
        as
 anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expect,   intend,   outlook, 
 may,   should,   will,  and  would  or similar words. Forward-looking
        statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by management
        in
        light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current
        conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are
        relevant. Although management believes that their assumptions are reasonable
        based on information currently available, those assumptions are subject to
        significant risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.
        The following factors, as well as the factors set forth in Item 1A of this
        Form
        10-K and any other cautionary language in this Form 10-K, provide examples
        of
        risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause our financial and operational
        results to differ materially from the expectations described in our
        forward-looking statements: 

general
        business and economic conditions; 

              the
        impact of competition; 

              our
        operating initiatives; 

              fluctuations
        in the costs of commodities, including beef, poultry, seafood, dairy, cheese
        and
        produce; 

              increases
        in utility costs, including the costs of natural gas and other energy
        supplies; 

              changes
        in the availability and cost of labor; 

              the
        seasonality of the business; 

              changes
        in governmental regulations, including changes in minimum wages; 

              the
        affects of inflation; 

              the
        availability of credit; 

              unfavorable
        publicity relating to operations, including publicity concerning food quality,
        illness or other health concerns or labor relations; and  

              the
        continued service of key management personnel. 

Each
        forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Form 10-K, and
        we
        undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
        statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
        Investors should be aware that the occurrence of the events described above
        and
        elsewhere in this Form 10-K could have material adverse effect on our business,
        results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

PART
        I   

Item
        1.        Business   

Overview   

        Luby's,
        Inc. (formerly, Luby's Cafeterias, Inc.) was founded in 1947 in San Antonio,
        Texas. Our company was originally incorporated in Texas in 1959 and was
        reincorporated in Delaware on December 31, 1991. Our corporate offices are
        located at 13111 Northwest Freeway, Suite 600, Houston, Texas 77040, and
        our
        telephone number at that address is (713) 329-6800. 

Luby's,
        Inc. was restructured into a holding company on February 1, 1997, at which
        time
        all of the operating assets were transferred to Luby's Restaurants Limited
        Partnership, a Texas limited partnership consisting of two wholly owned,
        indirect corporate subsidiaries. All restaurant operations are conducted
        by the
        partnership. In this report, unless otherwise specified,  Luby s,   we,   our, 
 us  and  our company  refer to the partnership and the consolidated corporate
        subsidiaries of Luby's, Inc. Our company operates under only one business
        segment.  

As
        of
        November 3, 2006, we operated 128 restaurants, of which 126 are traditional
        cafeterias and two primarily serve seafood. These establishments are located
        in
        close proximity to retail centers, business developments and residential
        areas
        in five states. Of the 128 restaurants, 93 are locations owned by us and
        35 are
        on leased premises. 

Operations   

        We
        provide guests with a wide variety of delicious, home-style food, with the
        majority of locations serving food in a cafeteria-style manner. Daily, each
        restaurant offers 20 to 22 entrees, 12 to 14 vegetable dishes, 12 to 16 salads,
        and 16 to 20 varieties of desserts. Food is prepared in small quantities
        throughout serving hours, and frequent quality checks are
        conducted. 

Our
        historical marketing research has shown that our products appeal to a broad
        range of value-oriented consumers, in particular among families with children,
        seniors, shoppers, travelers, and business people looking for a quick,
        home-style meal at a reasonable price. During fiscal 2006, we spent
        approximately 2.1% of our sales on traditional marketing venues, including
        television and radio advertisements in English and Spanish, newsprint,
        point-of-purchase and local-store marketing.  

Luby's
        restaurants are generally open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. All
        of
        our restaurants sell take-out orders, and many have separate food-to-go
        entrances, which provide guests the option to take complete and flavorful
        meals
        to their home or office. We also seek to provide culinary contract services
        for
        organizations that offer on-site food service, such as healthcare
        facilities. 

Food
        is
        prepared fresh daily at our restaurants. Menus are reviewed periodically
        by a
        committee of managers and chefs. The committee introduces newly developed
        recipes to ensure offerings are varied and that seasonal food preferences
        are
        incorporated. 

Quality
        control teams also help to maintain uniform standards of food preparation.
        The
        teams visit each restaurant as necessary and work with the staff to confirm
        adherence to our recipes, train personnel in new techniques, and implement
        systems and procedures used universally throughout our company. 

We
        operate from a centralized purchasing arrangement to obtain the economic
        benefit
        of bulk purchasing and lower prices for most of our food products. The
        arrangement involves a competitively selected prime vendor for each of our
        three
        major purchasing regions. 

During
        the fiscal year ended August 30, 2006, we closed two underperforming units.

4 

As
        of
        November 3, 2006, we had a workforce of 8,210 consisting of 7,700 non-management
        restaurant workers, 323 restaurant managers and 187 clerical, administrative
        and
        executive employees. Each restaurant is operated as a separate unit under
        the
        control of a general manager who has responsibility for day-to-day operations,
        including food production and personnel employment and supervision. Our
        philosophy is to grant authority to restaurant managers to direct the daily
        operations of their stores and, in turn, to compensate them on the basis
        of
        their performance. We believe this strategy to be a significant factor in
        restaurant profitability. Of the 128 general managers, 84 have more than
        ten
        years of experience at Luby s. This large percentage of tenured general managers
        enhances our execution. Employee relations are considered to be good. We
        have
        never had a strike or work stoppage, and we are not subject to collective
        bargaining agreements.  

Luby s
        uses several service marks, including  Luby's,  and believes that such marks are
        of material importance to its business. The Company has federal registrations
        for its service marks as deemed appropriate. 

Item
        1A.        Risk
        Factors   

An
        investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors
        should
        consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, and all other
        information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding
        whether
        to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
        known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important
        factors that may harm our business, financial condition or results of
        operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our
        business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price
        of
        our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties,
        and
        investors may lose part or all of their investment. 

We
        face intense competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our
        business and financial performance will be adversely
        affected.   

        The
        restaurant industry is intensely competitive and is affected by changes in
        customer tastes and dietary habits and by national, regional and local economic
        conditions and demographic trends. New menu items, concepts, and trends are
        constantly emerging. We compete on quality, variety, value, service, concept,
        price, and location with well-established national and regional chains, as
        well
        as with locally owned and operated restaurants. We face significant competition
        from family-style restaurants, fast-casual restaurants, and buffets as well
        as
        fast food restaurants. In addition, we also face growing competition as a
        result
        of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli, and restaurant services,
        particularly in the supermarket industry, which offers  convenient meals  in the
        form of improved entr es and side dishes from the deli section. Many of our
        competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. We
        also
        compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for restaurant sites
        and personnel. We anticipate that intense competition will continue. If we
        are
        unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results
        of
        operations would be materially adversely affected. 

Changes
        in customer preferences for cafeteria-style dining could adversely affect
        our
        financial performance.   

        Changing
        customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our
        business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees,
        side
        dishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the
        popularity of our cuisine and cafeteria-style dining. A change away from
        this
        cuisine or dining style could have a material adverse effect on our results
        of
        operations.  

We
        face the risk of adverse publicity and litigation, the cost of which could
        have
        a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

We
        may
        from time to time be the subject of complaints or litigation from customers
        alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns.
        Publicity resulting from these allegations may materially adversely affect
        us,
        regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are liable.
        In
        addition, we are subject to employee claims alleging injuries, wage and hour
        violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. In recent
        years,
        a number of restaurant companies have been subject to lawsuits, including
        class
        action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state law regarding
        workplace, employment and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have
        resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Regardless
        of
        whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately determined
        to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money
        away from our operations and hurt our financial performance. A judgment
        significantly in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, for any claims
        could
        materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of
        operations. 

5 

Unfavorable
        publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants or to the restaurant
        industry in general may taint public perception of the Luby's brand. Multi-unit
        restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from
        poor
        food quality, illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming
        from
        one or a limited number of restaurants. 

Our
          planned expansion may not be successful.   

          We
          have
          begun development of two new cafeteria restaurants in Texas, which we currently
          expect to open in 2007. Our ability to open and profitably operate restaurants
          is subject to various risks such as the identification and availability
          of
          suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable
          lease
          or purchase terms for new locations, the need to obtain all required
          governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the
          need to
          comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary
          contractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials
          and
          labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, the ability
          to
          manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could delay
          construction, increases in labor and building materials costs, the availability
          of financing at acceptable rates and terms, changes in weather or other
          acts of
          God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results
          of
          one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time, our ability
          to hire
          and train qualified management personnel and general economic and business
          conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants
          and
          retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction contractors,
          management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable
          to
          successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs and lower
          than
          anticipated revenues and earnings in future periods.  

Our
        business is affected by local, state and federal
        regulations.   

        The
        restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws
        and
        regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a
        significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which
        are
        subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations
        and
        requirements. We are also subject to licensing and regulation by state and
        local
        authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, building
        codes and liquor licenses, federal and state laws governing our relationships
        with employees (including the Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable minimum
        wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, family leave, tip credits,
        working conditions, safety standards and citizenship requirements), federal
        and
        state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design
        and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act
        of
        1990.  

In
        addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and
        regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal
        of
        hazardous materials. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect
        of
        future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements
        and
        the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and
        regulations could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business
        and
        therefore, have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to
        comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local
        authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required
        licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal
        liability. 

Labor
        shortages or increases in labor costs could harm our
        business.   

        Our
        success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain
        a
        sufficient number of qualified employees, including regional managers,
        restaurant general managers and chefs, in a manner consistent with our standards
        and expectations. Qualified individuals that we need to fill these positions
        are
        in short supply and competition for these employees is intense. If we are
        unable
        to recruit and retain sufficient qualified individuals, our operations and
        reputation could be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for qualified
        employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher
        labor costs. If our labor costs increase, our results of operations will
        be
        negatively affected. 

An
        increase in the minimum wage could adversely affect our financial
        performance.   

        From
        time
        to time, the U.S. Congress considers an increase in the federal minimum wage.
        The restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and if the federal minimum
        wage is increased, we may not be able to transfer all of the resulting increases
        in operating costs to our customers in the form of price increases. In addition,
        since our business is labor-intensive, shortages in the labor pool or other
        inflationary pressure could increase labor costs, which could harm our financial
        performance. 

6 

If
            we are unable to anticipate and react to changes in food, utility and
            other
            costs, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Many
            of
            the food and beverage products we purchase are affected by commodity
            pricing,
            and as such, are subject to price volatility caused by production problems,
            shortages, weather or other factors outside of our control. Our profitability
            depends, in part, on our successfully anticipating and reacting to changes
            in
            the prices of commodities. Therefore, we enter into purchase commitments
            with
            suppliers when we believe that it is advantageous for us to do so. Should
            there
            be an adverse change in commodity prices, we may be forced to absorb
            the
            additional costs rather than transfer the resulting increases in commodity
            prices to our customers in the form of price increases. Our success also
            depends, in part, on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs.
            Our
            operating results are affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities.
            Our
            inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change
            in any of
            these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our results
            of
            operations. 

Because
          our restaurants are concentrated in Texas, regional events can adversely
          affect
          our financial performance.    

          Approximately
          95% of our restaurants were located in Texas as of November 3, 2006. Our
          remaining restaurants are located in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, and
          Oklahoma.
          This concentration could adversely affect our financial performance in
          a number
          of ways. For example, our results of operations may be adversely affected
          by
          economic conditions in Texas or the Southern United States or the occurrence
          of
          an event of terrorism or natural disaster in any of the communities in
          which we
          operate. Also, given our geographic concentration, adverse publicity relating
          to
          our restaurants could have a more pronounced adverse effect on our overall
          revenues than might be the case if our restaurants were more broadly
          dispersed. 

Inclement
        weather can adversely affect our financial
        performance.   

        Many
        of
        our restaurants are located in the Texas Gulf Coast region. Although we
        generally maintain property and casualty insurance to protect against property
        damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, inclement weather, flooding,
        hurricanes and other acts of God can adversely impact our sales in several
        ways.
        For example, poor weather typically discourages potential customers from
        going
        out to eat. In addition, a restaurant that is damaged by a natural disaster
        can
        be inoperable for a significant amount of time. 

If
        we lose the services of any of our key management personnel, our business
        could
        suffer.   

        The
        success of our business is highly dependent upon our key management personnel,
        particularly Christopher J. Pappas, President and Chief Executive Officer,
        and
        Harris J. Pappas, Chief Operating Officer. The loss of the services of any
        key
        management personnel could have a materially adverse effect upon our
        business. 

Our
        business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, and, as a result, our results
        of
        operations for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that
        may
        be achieved for the full fiscal year.   

        Our
        business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, our highest earnings
        have occurred in the third quarter of the fiscal year, as our revenues in
        most
        of our restaurants have typically been higher during the third quarter of
        the
        fiscal year. Similarly, our results of operations for any single quarter
        will
        not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full
        fiscal year. 

General
        economic factors may adversely affect our results of
        operations.   

        National,
        regional and local economic conditions, such as recessionary economic cycles,
        a
        protracted economic slowdown or a worsening economy, could adversely affect
        disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. Unfavorable changes in
        these
        factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our customers
        could reduce customer traffic in some or all of our restaurants, impose
        practical limits on our pricing and increase our costs, any of which could
        lower
        our profit margins and have a material adverse affect on our results of
        operations.  

Inflation
        can negatively affect our financial performance.   

        The
        impact of inflation on food, labor and other aspects of our business can
        negatively affect our results of operations. Commodity inflation in food,
        beverages and utilities can also impact our financial performance. Although
        we
        attempt to offset inflation through periodic menu price increases, cost controls
        and incremental improvement in operating margins, we may not be able to
        completely do so which could negatively affect our results of
        operations.

Item
        2.        Properties   

Our
        restaurants typically contain 8,000 to 10,500 square feet of floor space
        and can
        seat 250 to 300 guests simultaneously.     our
        restaurants are well maintained and in good condition. In order to maintain
        appearance and operating efficiency, we refurbish and update our restaurants
        and
        equipment and perform scheduled maintenance.  

As
        of
        November 3, 2006, our restaurants were regionally located as follows: one
        in
        Arizona, two in Arkansas, two in Louisiana, two in Oklahoma, and 121 in Texas.

We
        own
        the underlying land and buildings in which 93 of our restaurants are located.
        Nine of these restaurant properties contain excess building space, which
        is leased to tenants unaffiliated with our company. 

In
        addition to the owned locations, 35 other restaurants are held under leases,
        including 11 in regional shopping malls. Most of the leases provide for a
        combination of fixed-dollar and percentage rentals. Many require us to pay
        additional amounts related to property taxes, hazard insurance and maintenance
        of common areas. Of the 35 restaurant leases, the current terms of 12 expire
        before 2010, 13 expire between 2010 to 2014, and ten thereafter. Of the 35
        restaurant leases, 31 can be extended beyond their current terms at our option.
        We lease approximately 25,000 square feet of corporate office space, which
        extends through 2011. The corporate office space is located off the Northwest
        Freeway in Houston, Texas in close proximity to many of our Houston restaurant
        locations. We also lease warehouse space in the Houston, Texas area (see
         Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations - Affiliations and Related Parties - Affiliations  in Item 7 of this
        report). See Note 10,  Operating Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements in Item 8 of this report for information concerning our lease
        rental
        expenses and lease commitments. 

Additionally,
        as of November 3, 2006, we had three owned properties, with a carrying value
        of
        approximately $1.7 million, and three ground lease properties, with a zero
        carrying value, that are held for sale. 

We
        maintain public liability insurance and property damage insurance on our
        properties in amounts which management believes to be adequate. 

Item
        3.        Legal
        Proceedings   

We
        are
        from time to time subject to claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary
        course
        of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of pending
        claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our operations
        or
        consolidated financial position. There are no material legal proceedings
        to
        which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any associate of any
        such
        director or officer, is a party, or has a material interest, adverse to our
        company.

Five-Year
        Summary of Operations   

(a)      Fiscal
        year ended August 30, 2005 consists of 53 weeks, while all other periods
        presented consist of 52 weeks. 

         (b)      See
         Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations - Debt  in Item 7 of this report and Note 7,  Debt , of the Notes to
        Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Note   :
        Fiscal
        year 2002, the year in which we moved from 12 calendar months to 13 four-week
        periods, was 362 days in length. Fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2006 were each 364
        days
        in length. Fiscal 2005, however, was a 53 week year and was 371 days in length.

Note   :
        Our
        business plan, as approved in fiscal 2003, called for the closure of
        approximately 50 locations. In accordance with the plan, the entire fiscal
        activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan
        have
        been reclassified to discontinued operations. For comparison purposes, prior
        fiscal years results related to these same locations have also been reclassified
        to discontinued operations.

Item
        7.        Management's
        Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
        Operations   

Management's
        discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations
        should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
        and
        footnotes for the fiscal years ended August 30, 2006, August 31, 2005 and
        August
        25, 2004 included in Item 8 of this report. 

Overview   

        As
        of
        November 3, 2006, we operated 128 restaurants, of which 126 are traditional
        cafeterias and two primarily serve seafood. These establishments are located
        in
        close proximity to retail centers, business developments, and residential
        areas
        throughout five states.  Of the 128 restaurants, 93 are operated on
        sites owned by us and 35 are on leased premises. Not included in the 128
        currently operating units is one leased, traditional cafeteria-style restaurant
        which was closed and the lease terminated, due to storm damage.  

Reclassification   

        Our
        business plan, as approved in fiscal 2003, called for the closure of over
        50 locations. In accordance with the plan, the entire fiscal activity of
        the
        applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been reclassified
        to discontinued operations. For comparison purposes, prior period results
        related to these same locations have also been reclassified to discontinued
        operations. 

Accounting
        Periods   

        Our
        fiscal year ends on the last Wednesday in August. As such, each fiscal year
        normally consists of 13 four-week periods, or accounting periods, accounting
        for
        364 days in the aggregate. Each of the first three quarters of each fiscal
        year
        consists of three four-week periods, while the fourth quarter normally consists
        of four four-week periods. Fiscal 2006 was a 52-week year, while fiscal 2005
        was
        a 53-week year for us, with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter.
        Comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of
        the
        quarters, as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business.

Same-Store Sales   

        The
        restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality, concept,
        location, price, and service, all of which may have an effect on same-store
        sales. Our same-store sales calculation measures the relative performance
        of a
        certain group of restaurants. To qualify for inclusion in this group, a store
        must have been in operation for 18 consecutive accounting periods. Although
        management believes this approach leads to more effective year-over-year
        comparisons, neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar
        to
        those used by other restaurant companies. 

Same-store
        sales increased 4.6%, 6.3%, and 1.3% for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004,
        respectively. Same-store sales removes the additional week of sales in fiscal
        2005 and compares sales year-over-year for periods which include approximately
        the same calendar dates.  

This
        approach was also applied to same-store sales for fiscal quarters, adjusting
        for
        the additional week in fiscal fourth quarter 2005. The following table shows
        the
        same-store sales change for comparative historical quarters: 

Hurricane
        Impact      

Hurricane
          Rita impacted a number of our markets during the first quarter of fiscal
          2006 as
          we were forced to temporarily close many stores due to mandatory evacuations
          and
          subsequent power outages. We experienced a store closure impact of 236
          store
          days of operations due to Hurricane Rita. One unit in Port Arthur, Texas
          suffered permanent damage and the lease has been terminated. All other
          restaurants impacted by the storm suffered minimal damage and were reopened
          soon
          after the storm passed. The store closure impact on our results of operations
          was offset by increased traffic at certain units and catering events relating
          to
          the hurricane relief effort.

RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS  

Fiscal
        2006 (52 weeks) compared to Fiscal 2005 (53 weeks)   

        Sales
        increased approximately $6.2 million, or 2.0%, in fiscal 2006 compared to
        fiscal
        2005.   On
        a
        same-store basis, sales increased approximately $8.5 million, or 2.7%. Excluding
        the additional, or 53   rd   ,
        week of
        sales included in fiscal year 2005, same-store sales growth for fiscal 2006
        was
        approximately $14.2 million, or 4.6%. 

Food
        costs increased approximately $1.3 million, or 1.5%, in fiscal 2006 compared
        to
        fiscal 2005 due to slightly higher commodity prices for seafood and
        produce, which were partially offset by slightly lower commodity prices for
        poultry and dairy. Our promotion of combination meals have provided favorable
        cost structures. As a percentage of sales, food costs decreased 0.1%, from
        26.7%
        in fiscal 2005 to 26.6% in fiscal 2006.  

Payroll
        and related costs decreased $1.2 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2006 compared
        to
        fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales, these costs decreased 1.0%, from 35.6%
        in
        fiscal 2005 to 34.6% in fiscal 2006, due to operational focus and lower workers 
compensation expense, including the effects of reduced actuarial estimates
        of
        potential losses resulting from favorable claims experience. 

Other
        operating expenses increased by $5.0 million, or 7.7%, for fiscal 2006 compared
        to fiscal 2005. As a percentage of sales these costs increased 1.1%, and
        were
        driven by higher utilities costs as well as higher restaurant supply and
        repair
        and maintenance costs, while being partially offset by a $1.1 million insurance
        recovery associated with a business interruption claim due to Hurricane Rita,
        recorded as a reduction to operating expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal
        2006. Subsequent to year-end, we collected approximately $1.0 million related
        to
        this claim. 

Depreciation
        and amortization expense increased by approximately $0.7 million, or 4.7%,
        in
        fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to increased capital expenditures
        in
        fiscal 2006. 

Relocation
        and voluntary severance costs decreased by $0.7 million in fiscal 2006
        compared to fiscal 2005 since no costs of this nature were incurred during
        fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2005, we incurred costs of approximately $0.7
        million
        related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to Houston,
        Texas. 

General
        and administrative expenses increased by approximately $2.1 million, or 10.6%,
        in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.  
        As a
        percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.9%
        in
        fiscal 2006 compared to 6.4% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to i  ncreased
        staffing and share-based compensation expenses. 

The
        provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings increased by
        approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. This change
        is primarily due to asset impairment and lease settlement costs in fiscal
        2006. 

The
        net
        loss (gain) on disposition of property and equipment increased by approximately
        $1.6 million in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. This change is primarily
        due to the retirement of obsolete equipment that was identified during our
        fiscal 2006 review of restaurant equipment at all of our restaurants and
        at our
        Houston Service Center. 

Interest
        expense, net, decreased approximately $10.7 million, or 93.9%, in fiscal
        2006
        compared to fiscal 2005. This decrease was primarily due to an $8.0 million
        write-off of the unamortized portion of the discount associated with convertible
        subordinated notes upon their conversion to common stock in August 2005,
        in
        combination with the elimination of outstanding debt and lower interest rates
        following the refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness in 2005. 

Other
        income, net, increased by approximately $0.3 million   in
        fiscal
        2006 compared to fiscal 2005,  
        primarily due to the increase in prepaid state sales tax discounts and the
        write-off of expired gift certificates. 

The
        income tax benefit for fiscal 2006 primarily represents the recognition of
        tax
        benefits for net operating losses not recognized in previous years due to
        uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them. (See Note 3,  Income Taxes ,
        of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report).
        Unlike recent fiscal years, when income tax expenses and benefits were not
        recognized due to unutilized net operating losses and related valuation
        allowance, our provision for income taxes in future periods will be reflective
        of the tax effect of the pre-tax income (losses) recognized in those periods
        once all of our net operating losses are fully utilized. Additionally, the
        recently-enacted Texas Franchise Tax will impact future income tax
        provisions. 

12 

The
        net
        loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately $3.5 million
        in
        fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005, principally because we no longer have
        any
        deferred financing costs or interest associated with closed stores in
        2006. 
 
          Fiscal
        2005 (53 weeks) Compared to Fiscal 2004 (52 weeks)   

        Sales
        increased $24.2 million, or 8.2%, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.
        Approximately $6.0 million of the increase is attributable to an additional,
        or
        53   rd   ,
        week of
        sales included in fiscal year 2005 versus fiscal year 2004 which was 52 weeks
        in
        length. Excluding the additional week, same-store sales growth for fiscal
        2005
        was 6.3%. Marketing promotions, continued customer appeal of the new combination
        meals, and improved product and service execution all contributed to our
        same-store sales growth. 

All
        of
        our sales during fiscal 2005 were characterized as same-store sales. In fiscal
        2005, seven units were closed and reclassified to discontinued operations.

Food
        costs increased $6.3 million, or 8.0%, and were relatively flat as a percentage
        of sales in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Higher commodity prices
        for
        beef, seafood and fresh produce were slightly offset by lower poultry and
        dairy
        prices and the continued rollout of new combination meals with favorable
        cost
        structures. 

Payroll
        and related costs increased $2.3 million, or 2.1%, in fiscal 2005 compared
        to
        fiscal 2004. As a percentage of sales, payroll and related costs were 35.6%
        in
        fiscal 2005 compared to 37.8% in fiscal 2004. The decrease as a percentage
        of
        sales was primarily the result of a reduction in workers  compensation expense
        and enhanced productivity due to effective labor deployment. The reduction
        in
        workers' compensation expense was due to revised reserve requirements resulting
        from reductions in recent claims experience. These reductions in expense
        were
        partially offset by greater store management compensation expense. 

Other
        operating expenses increased $5.0 million, or 8.3%, in fiscal 2005 compared
        to
        fiscal 2004. As a percentage of sales, other operating expenses remained
        flat.
        Increased advertising costs associated with our television marketing campaign
        and increased utility costs due to rising natural gas prices were offset
        by
        lower repairs and maintenance and insurance costs. 

Depreciation
        and amortization expense decreased $1.3 million, or 8.0%, in fiscal 2005
        compared to fiscal 2004. This decrease was a result of a reduction in the
        depreciable base of our property and equipment.  

Relocation
        and voluntary severance costs related to the relocation of our corporate
        offices
        to Houston, Texas decreased approximately $0.2 million as the majority of
        the
        cost associated with the relocation included voluntary severance costs accrued
        in fiscal 2004. The remaining relocation costs were expensed as incurred
        in
        fiscal 2005.  

General
        and administrative expenses increased $1.4 million, or 7.2%, in fiscal 2005
        compared to fiscal 2004. This increase was driven primarily by professional
        service costs related to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
        consulting fees associated with the implementation of new point-of-sale and
        accounting systems. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative
        expenses remained flat in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004.  

The
        net
        gain on disposition of property and equipment decreased by approximately
        $0.3
        million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. This change was primarily
        due to
        a reduction in gains recorded on the sale of obsolete equipment. 

Interest
        expense, net, increased $3.5 million, or 44.1%, primarily due to an $8.0
        million
        write-off of the unamortized portion of the discount associated with the
        convertible subordinated notes, which were converted to common stock in August
        2005. This increase was partially offset by a $4.4 million decrease in interest
        expense due primarily to the continued reduction in outstanding debt under
        the
        line of credit. 

Other
        income, net, decreased approximately $1.5 million primarily due to the
        recognition in fiscal 2004 of a gain on a sales and leaseback transaction.
        (See
        Note 10,  Operating Leases , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
        in Item 8 of this report).  

13 

The
        provision (benefit) for income taxes changed by approximately $3.0 million
        in
        fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2004, we recognized a $2.9
        million tax benefit related to a reduction in the income tax valuation allowance
        triggered by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the modification
        of the beneficial conversion feature on convertible subordinated debt.
        Additionally, because our loss carryforward more than offset fiscal 2004
        income
        from continuing operations, we did not provide for any income tax with respect
        to this income.  

        The
        loss
        from discontinued operations decreased by $4.2 million in fiscal 2005 compared
        to fiscal 2004 primarily due to significant losses and impairments associated
        with discontinued operations incurred and taken in fiscal 2004 related to
        store
        closures. During fiscal 2005, impairments and losses associated with
        discontinued operations were offset by gains recognized on the sale of related
        properties.  

LIQUIDITY
        AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   

        Cash
        and
        cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $5.3 million from
        the
        end of fiscal 2005 to August 30, 2006, primarily due to cash flows from
        operations and proceeds from sales of properties, partially offset by debt
        repayment and capital expenditures. 

Working
        Capital   

        We
        had a
        working capital deficit of $17.7 million as of August 30, 2006, which
        represented an $8.5 million improvement compared to $26.2 million as of August
        31, 2005. We expect to meet our working capital requirements through cash
        flows
        from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit
        Facility. 

Capital
        Expenditures   

        Capital
        expenditures for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2006 were approximately
        $15.9
        million. We primarily used our capital funds to maintain our investment in
        existing operating units. We expect to be able to fund all capital expenditures
        in fiscal 2007 using cash flows from operations and our available credit.
        Under
        our credit facility, $25.0  
        m  illion
        plus a limited unused prior-year carryover amount, subject to certain terms,
        are
        available for funding capital expenditures in fiscal 2007.   We
        expect
        to spend approximately $20.0 million to $24.0 million on capital expenditures
        in
        fiscal 2007. 

DEBT  

Revolving
        Credit Facility   

        On
        August
        31, 2005, we entered into an amended and restated, $45.0 million unsecured
        Revolving Credit Facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) with a syndicate of
        three independent banks. The Revolving Credit Facility may, subject to certain
        terms and conditions, be increased by an additional $15.0 million for a total
        facility size of $60.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facility allows for
        up to
        $10.0 million of the available credit to be extended in the form of letters
        of
        credit. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates, and all amounts owing
        thereunder must be repaid, on August 31, 2008. 

At
        any
        time throughout the term of the facility, we have the option to elect one
        of two
        bases of interest rates. One interest rate option is the greater of (a) the
        federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or (b) prime, plus, in either case,
        an
        applicable spread that ranges from 0% to 0.25% per annum. The other interest
        rate option is LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable spread
        that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum. The applicable spread under each
        option is dependent upon certain measures of our financial performance at
        the
        time of election. 

We
        also
        pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Revolving
        Credit Facility, which is also dependent upon our financial performance,
        ranging
        from 0.25% to 0.35% per annum. We also are obligated to pay certain fees
        in
        respect of any letters of credit issued as well as an administrative fee
        to the
        lender acting as administrative agent. Finally, we were obligated to pay
        the
        lenders a one-time fee in connection with the closing of the Revolving Credit
        Facility. 

The
        Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on
        our
        ability to engage in certain activities, including financial performance
        covenants and limitations on capital expenditures, asset sales and acquisitions,
        and contains customary events of default. As of August 30, 2006, we were
        in full
        compliance with all covenants. 

All
        amounts owed by us under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by
        our
        subsidiaries. 

14 

We
        primarily used proceeds received on the sale of properties, operating cash
        flows, short-term investments and the new facility to pay off our prior term
        loan and prior line of credit. As of August 30, 2006, no amounts were
        outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Additionally,
        at August 30, 2006, we had a total of approximately $5.1 million committed
        under
        letters of credit which have been issued as security for the payment of
        insurance obligations classified as accrued expenses on the balance sheet.
        An
        additional $4.9 million may be issued under letters of credit. 

Conversion
        of Subordinated Notes   

        On
        August
        31, 2005, Christopher J. Pappas, our President and Chief Executive Officer,
        and
        Harris J. Pappas, our Chief Operating Officer, each voluntarily converted
        all of
        the convertible senior subordinated notes they held into our common stock.
        Each
        of them converted $5.0 million principal amount of convertible senior
        subordinated notes at a conversion price of $3.10 per share into 1,612,903
        shares of our common stock. In connection with this conversion, we recognized
        a
        one time non-cash charge of approximately $8.0 million representing the
        write-off of the unamortized portion of the discount associated with the
        conversion feature of the convertible senior subordinated notes. The shares
        issued pursuant to the conversion were treasury shares that had previously
        been
        reserved for such a conversion.  

COMMITMENTS
        AND CONTINGENCIES  

Off-Balance-Sheet
        Arrangements   

        We
        have
        no off-balance-sheet structured financing arrangements.  

Contractual
        Obligations   

        At
        August
        30, 2006, we had contractual obligations and other commercial commitments
        as
        described below: 

(a)      Operating
        lease obligations contain rent escalations and renewal options ranging from
        five
        to thirty years. 

We
        had no
        long-term debt, capital lease or purchase obligations at August 30, 2006.

In
        addition to the commitments represented in the above tables, we enter into
        a
        number of cancelable and noncancelable commitments during the year. Typically,
        these commitments are for less than a year in duration and are generally
        focused
        on food inventory. We do not maintain any long-term or exclusive commitments
        or
        arrangements to purchase products from any single supplier. Substantially
        all of
        our product purchase commitments are cancelable up to 30 days prior to the
        vendor's scheduled shipment date.  

15 

Long-term
        liabilities reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of August
        30,
        2006 included amounts accrued for benefit payments under our supplemental
        executive retirement plan of $  229,000,  
        deferred
        compensation agreements of $  124,000  ,
        accrued
        insurance reserves of $  2.6
          million,
        deferred rent liabilities of $  3.7
          million
        and reserves for restaurant closings of $  336,000  . 

We
        are
        also contractually obligated to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
        Operating Officer pursuant to employment agreements. See  Affiliations and
        Related Parties   Related Parties  for further information. 

AFFILIATIONS
        AND RELATED PARTIES  

Affiliations   

        We
        entered into an Affiliate Services Agreement effective August 31, 2001 with
        two
        companies, Pappas Partners, L.P. and Pappas Restaurants, Inc. (the  Pappas
        entities ), which are restaurant entities owned by Christopher J. Pappas and
        Harris J. Pappas, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer,
        respectively. That agreement was amended on July 23, 2002 to limit the scope
        of
        expenditures therein to professional and consulting services. 

Additionally,
        on July 23, 2002, we entered into a Master Sales Agreement with the Pappas
        entities. Through this agreement, we contractually separated the design and
        fabrication of equipment and furnishings from the Affiliate Services Agreement.
        The Master Sales Agreement covers the costs incurred for modifications to
        existing equipment, as well as custom fabrication, including stainless steel
        stoves, shelving, rolling carts, and chef tables. These items are
        custom-designed and built to fit the designated kitchens and are also engineered
        to give a longer service life than comparably manufactured
        equipment. 

The
        pricing of equipment, repair, and maintenance is set and evaluated periodically
        and is considered by management to be primarily at or below market for
        comparable goods and services. To assist in periodically monitoring pricing
        of
        the transactions associated with the Master Sales Agreement and the Affiliate
        Services Agreement, the Finance and Audit Committee of our Board of Directors
        has periodically used independent valuation consultants. The Affiliate Services
        Agreement expired on December 31, 2005. 

As
        part
        of the affiliation with the Pappas entities, we lease a facility, the Houston
        Service Center, in which we have installed a centralized restaurant service
        center to support field operations. The building at this location has 22,253
        square feet of warehouse space and 5,664 square feet of office space and
        is
        leased from the Pappas entities at an approximate monthly rate of $0.24 per
        square foot. From this center, our repair and service teams are dispatched
        to
        our restaurants when facility or equipment maintenance and servicing are
        needed.
        The facility is also used for repair and storage of new and used equipment.
        We
        paid approximately $  82,000,
          $88,000,
        and $82,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, pursuant to the
        terms
        of this lease. 

We
        previously leased from an unrelated third party a location used to house
        increased equipment inventories due to store closures under our business
        plan.
        We considered it more prudent to lease this location rather than to pursue
        purchasing a storage facility, given our strategy to focus our capital
        expenditures on our operating restaurants. In a separate transaction, the
        third-party property owner sold the location to the Pappas entities during
        the
        fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, with the Pappas entities becoming our landlord
        for that location effective August 1, 2003. The storage site complements
        the
        Houston Service Center with approximately 27,000 square feet of warehouse
        space
        at an approximate monthly rate of $0.21 per square foot. We paid approximately
        $  67,000,
          $72,000,
        and $69,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, pursuant to the
        terms
        of this lease. 

Late
          in
          the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Chris and Harris Pappas became limited
          partners in a limited partnership which purchased a retail strip center
          in
          Houston, Texas. Messrs. Pappas own a 50% limited partnership interest.
          Neither of Messrs. Pappas own any interest in the general partner of the
          limited partnership. The general partner of the limited partnership controls
          the
          operational decisions of the partnership. One of our restaurants has rented
          approximately 7% of the space in that center since July 1969. No changes
          were
          made to our lease terms as a result of the transfer of ownership of the
          center
          to the new partnership. We paid approximately $  266,000,
          $276,000 and $83,000  
          in
          fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, pursuant to the terms of this
          lease. 

Affiliated
        rents paid for the Houston Service Center, the separate storage facility,
        the
        Dallas property and the Houston property leases combined represented
  9.8%,  
        8.8%,
        and 5.6% of total rents for continuing operations in fiscal 2006, 2005, and
        2004, respectively.

The
        following table compares current and prior fiscal year-to-date charges incurred
        under the Master Sales Agreement, the Affiliate Services Agreement and
        affiliated property leases to our total capital expenditures, as well as
        relative general and administrative expenses and occupancy and other operating
        expenses included in continuing operations:

        and
        Documentation Agent of, the Revolving Credit Facility. 

Related
        Parties   

In
          November 2005, Christopher and Harris Pappas entered into new employment
          agreements expiring in August 2008. Both continue to devote their primary
          time
          and business efforts to Luby's, while maintaining their roles at Pappas
          Restaurants, Inc. 

CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

Our
        accounting policies are described in Note 1,  Nature of Operations and
        Significant Accounting Policies,  of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
        Statements in Item 8 of this report. The Consolidated Financial Statements
        are
        prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
        Preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates
        and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the
        financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
        Management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to
        the
        significant, subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing
        our consolidated financial statements. Management regularly reviews these
        assumptions and estimates with the Finance and Audit Committee of our Board
        of
        Directors. 

Income
        Taxes   

        We
        record
        the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax
        bases
        of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated
        balance sheets, as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and
        carryforwards. We periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded
        on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems
        necessary. Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax
        laws
        that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates
        of tax liability. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions
        and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management's opinion,
        adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. Historically,
        the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) periodically has reviewed our company. We
        recently settled an audit adjustment with the IRS in connection with the
        review
        of fiscal 2003, and we are currently under review for the 2002, 2001 and
        2000
        fiscal years. The IRS review could result in a reduction of the deductions
        claimed on our returns and additional income taxes due. In August 2006, we
        settled an IRS audit of the 2003 fiscal year and agreed to a partial reduction
        of the loss claimed on the federal income tax return for the year. The result
        of
        the audit was a reduction of $7.4 million in the cumulative net operating
        losses
        carried forward to offset future taxable income. The total net operating
        losses
        being carried forward after the IRS audit adjustment is approximately $12.5
        million. 

17 

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets   

        We
        periodically evaluate long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
        circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
        recoverable. We estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use
        and
        possible disposition of the asset and will recognize an impairment loss when
        the
        sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying
        amounts of such assets. The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable
        and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's subjective
        judgments. The span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is
        often
        lengthy, which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made. Depending on
        the
        assumptions and estimates used, the estimated future cash flows projected
        in the
        evaluation of long-lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes.
        We consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best
        estimate of future cash flows. The measurement for such an impairment loss
        is
        then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash
        flows
        or appraisals, if available. 

Property
        Held for Sale    

        We
        also
        periodically review long-lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately
        dispose of properties. If we decide to dispose of a property, it will be
        moved
        to property held for sale and actively marketed. Property held for sale is
        recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to
        receive upon sale, less costs of disposal. We routinely monitor the estimated
        value of property held for sale and record adjustments to these values as
        required. We periodically measure and analyze our estimates against
        third-party appraisals.  

Insurance
        and Claims   

        We
        self-insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under
        our
        employee injury, workers  compensation and general liability programs. We
        maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our
        per-occurrence claim exposure. We have recorded accrued liabilities for
        self-insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates,
        and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability
        is
        appropriate. 

The
        significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self-insurance reserves,
        including incurred but not reported claims, are as follows: (1) historical
        patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in
        the
        past (Loss Development Method), (2) historical trend patterns and loss cost
        levels will continue in the future as they have in the past
        (Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method), and (3) historical claim counts and exposures
        are
        used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are
        analyzed to get a projected severity (Frequency and Severity Method). The
        results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves
        estimates. The third party actuary utilizes methods and assumptions that
        are in
        accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and believes the
        conclusions reached are reasonable. 

Actual
        workers  compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from
        estimated loss provisions. The ultimate level of claims under the in-house
        safety program are not known, and declines in incidence of claims as well
        as
        claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the
        program
        may not continue in future periods. 

Stock-Based
        Compensation   

        We
        adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123,  Share-Based Payments (Revised 2004) 
(SFAS 123R), effective September 1, 2005. Among other things, SFAS 123R
        eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation using APB
        25 and
        requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the
        income
        statement utilizing the fair values on the date of the grant. See Note 1,
         Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
        Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information. 

NEW
        ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In
        July
        2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
        Taxes - An Interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
        No.
        109  (FAS 109) was issued. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by
        prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required
        to meet
        before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides
        guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,
        accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 applies
        to all
        tax positions related to income taxes subject to FAS 109. FIN 48 is effective
        for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company plans to
        adopt
        this guidance effective for fiscal year 2008. We do not expect the adoption
        of
        this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial position,
        results
        of operations or cash flows. 

INFLATION  

Our
        policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations
        in food costs. General increases in costs of food, wages, supplies,
        transportation and services may require us to increase our menu prices from
        time
        to time. To the extent prevailing market conditions allow, we intend to adjust
        menu prices to maintain profit margins.  

18 

Item
        7A.        Quantitative
        and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

We
        are
        exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting our
        variable-rate debt. As of August 30, 2006, the total amount of debt subject
        to
        interest rate fluctuations outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility
        was
        zero.  

Although
        we are not currently using interest rate swaps, we have previously used and
        may
        in the future use these instruments to manage cash flow risk on a portion
        of our
        variable-rate debt. 

19 

Item
        8.           Financial
        Statements and Supplementary Data   

Report
        of Management   

Management
        is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
        over
        financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f)
        and
        15(d)-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
        financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements. Also,
        projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
        to
        risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
        or
        that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
        our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted
        an
        evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
        as of August 30, 2006 based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
        Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
        Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that
        our
        internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 30,
        2006. 

Management s
        assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
        as of August 30, 2006 has been audited by Ernst   Young LLP, an independent
        registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
        elsewhere herein.

         FINANCIAL

Report
        of
        Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders of Luby's, Inc. 

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Luby's, Inc. (the
        Company) as of August 30, 2006 and August 31, 2005, and the related consolidated
        statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of
        the
        three years in the period ended August 30, 2006. These financial statements
        are
        the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
        express
        an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the consolidated financial position of Luby's, Inc. at
        August
        30, 2006 and August 31, 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations
        and
        its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 30,
        2006,
        in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal 2006,
        Luby s Inc. changed its method of accounting for share-based compensation in
        accordance with guidance provided in the Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards No. 123 (R),  Share-Based Payments . 

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company s internal
        control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2006, based on criteria
        established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
        of
        Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report, dated
        November 6, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report
        of
        Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on 

        Internal
        Control over Financial Reporting 

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders of Luby's, Inc. 

We
        have
        audited management s assessment included in the accompanying Report of
        Management, that Luby s, Inc. (the Company) maintained effective internal
        control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2006, based on criteria
        established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
        of
        Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
        The
        Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
        over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
        control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
        on
        management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
        internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management s assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

A
        company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

In
        our
        opinion, management s assessment that Luby s Inc. maintained effective internal
        control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2006, is fairly stated,
        in all
        material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Luby s Inc.
        maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
        reporting as of August 30, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. 

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Luby s, Inc.
        as of August 30, 2006 and August 31, 2005, and the related consolidated
        statements of operations, shareholders  equity, and cash flows for each of the
        three years in the period ended August 30, 2006 of Luby s, Inc., and our report,
        dated November 6, 2006, expresses an unqualified opinion thereon.

        Fiscal
        Years 2006, 2005 and 2004 

Note
        1.       Nature
        of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies  

Nature
        of Operations   

        Luby's,
        Inc. is based in Houston, Texas. As of August 30, 2006, the Company owned
        and
        operated 128 restaurants, with 121 in Texas and the remainder in four other
        states. The Company's restaurant locations are convenient to shopping and
        business developments as well as to residential areas. Accordingly, the
        restaurants appeal primarily to shoppers, travelers, store and office personnel
        at lunch and to families at dinner. 

Principles
        of Consolidation    

        The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Luby's,
        Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Luby's, Inc. was restructured into
        a
        holding company on February 1, 1997, at which time all of the operating assets
        were transferred to Luby's Restaurants Limited Partnership, a Texas limited
        partnership composed of two wholly owned, indirect corporate subsidiaries
        of the
        Company. All restaurant operations are conducted by the partnership. Unless
        the
        context indicates otherwise, the word  Company  as used herein includes Luby's,
        Inc., the partnership, and the consolidated corporate subsidiaries of Luby's,
        Inc. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
        in consolidation.  

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents   

        Cash
        and
        cash equivalents include highly liquid investments such as money market funds
        that have a maturity of three months or less. Amounts receivable from credit
        card companies are also considered cash equivalents because they are both
        short-term and highly liquid in nature and are typically converted to cash
        within three days of the sales transaction. 

Inventories

The
        food
        and supply inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out)
        or
        market.  

Property
        Held for Sale    

        Property
        held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently
        expects to receive upon sale, less costs of disposal. The Company routinely
        monitors the estimated value of property held for sale and records adjustments
        to these values as required. For certain assets impaired, the Company may
        record
        subsequent adjustments for increases in fair value, but not in excess of
        cumulative losses previously recognized. 

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets   

        Impairment
        losses are recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators
        of
        impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated
        by those assets are less than the carrying amount. The Company evaluates
        impairments on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis and uses three or more years
        of
        negative cash flows and other market conditions as indicators of
        impairment. 

Debt
        Issuance Costs   

        Debt
        issuance costs include costs incurred in connection with the arrangement
        of
        long-term financing agreements. These costs are amortized using the effective
        interest method over the respective term of the debt to which they specifically
        relate.  

Financial
        Instruments   

        The
        estimated fair value of financial instruments held by the Company approximates
        the carrying value. 

Self-Insurance
        Accrued Expenses   

        The
        Company self-insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers'
        compensation, work injury, and general liability programs. Accrued liabilities
        have been recorded based on estimates of the ultimate costs to settle incurred
        claims, both reported and not yet reported. These recorded estimated liabilities
        are based on judgments and independent actuarial estimates, which include
        the
        use of claim-development factors based on loss history; economic conditions;
        the
        frequency or severity of claims and claim development patterns; and claim
        reserve, management, and settlement practices. 

27 

Revenue
        Recognition   

        Revenue
        from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold.
        Unearned revenues are recorded as a liability for dining cards that have
        been
        sold but not yet redeemed and are recorded at their expected redemption value.
        When dining cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized and unearned revenue
        is
        reduced.  

Advertising
        Expenses   

        Advertising
        costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expense was $6.7 million,
        $6.7
        million, and $4.4 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, of
        which
        $24,000, $167,000 and $258,000, in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively,
        related to stores included in discontinued operations and was reclassified
        accordingly.  

Depreciation
        and Amortization    

        Property
        and equipment are recorded at cost. The Company depreciates the cost of
        equipment over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method.
        Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their estimated useful
        lives or the related lease terms. Depreciation of buildings is provided on
        a
        straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives (generally 20 to 33 years,
        not to exceed 25 years for buildings located on leased properties). 

Operating
        Leases   

        The
        Company leases restaurant and administrative facilities and administrative
        equipment under operating leases. Building lease agreements generally include
        rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for
        a
        percentage of sales in excess of specified levels. Contingent rental expenses
        are recognized prior to the achievement of a specified target, provided that
        the
        achievement of the target is considered probable. Most of the Company s lease
        agreements include renewal periods at the Company s option. The Company
        recognizes rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line
        basis over the lease term beginning with the date the Company takes possession
        of the leased space. The Company records tenant improvement allowances and
        rent
        holidays as deferred rent expense on the consolidated statements of
        operations. 

Income
        Taxes   

        Deferred
        income taxes are computed using the liability method. Under this method,
        deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
        financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities (temporary
        differences) and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will
        be
        in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  

Management
        makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be
        challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax
        liability. In management's opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes
        have
        been made for all years. Historically, the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) has
        periodically reviewed the Company. The Company is currently under review
        for the
        2002, 2001 and 2000 fiscal years. 

Discontinued
        Operations   

        In
        August
        2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
        No.
        144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  The
        Company was required to adopt SFAS No. 144 as of August 29, 2002. The adoption
        of SFAS No. 144 extended the reporting of discontinued operations to all
        components of an entity from a segment of an entity. Beginning in fiscal
        2003,
        all qualifying disposal plans were reported as discontinued operations, and
        operations related to those disposals in prior years were reclassified as
        required. The results of disposal plans prior to the adoption continue to
        be
        included in continuing operations for all periods presented. 

Stock-Based
        Compensation   

        The
        Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123,  Share-Based Payments (Revised
        2004)  ( SFAS 123R ), effective September 1, 2005. Among other things, SFAS 123R
        eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation using APB
        25 and
        requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the
        income
        statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant. See Note 11,
         Employee Benefit Plans and Agreements , below. 

28 

Earnings
        Per Share   

        The
        Company presents basic income (loss) per common share and diluted income/loss
        per common share in accordance with SFAS No. 128,  Earnings Per Share.  Basic
        income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
        weighted-average number of shares outstanding during each period presented.
        In
        fiscal years 2005 and 2004, dilutive shares had a minimal effect on income
        (loss) per share.  

Accounting
        Periods   

        The
        Company's fiscal year generally consists of 13 four-week periods ending on
        the
        last Wednesday in August. Fiscal year 2005 consisted of 12 four-week periods
        and
        one five-week period. 

Use
        of Estimates   

        In
        preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
        accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
        that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
        of
        contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
        and
        revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
        from these estimates.  

Reclassifications   

        The
        Company's business plan, as approved in fiscal 2003, called for the closure
        of
        approximately 50 locations. In accordance with the plan, the entire fiscal
        activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan
        has
        been reclassified to discontinued operations. For comparison purposes, prior
        fiscal years results related to these same locations have also been reclassified
        to discontinued operations. Certain other reclassifications of prior period
        results have been made to conform to the current year presentation. 

New
        Accounting Pronouncements   

        In
        July
        2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
        Taxes - An Interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement
        No.
        109  (FAS 109) was issued. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by
        prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required
        to meet
        before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides
        guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties,
        accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 applies
        to all
        tax positions related to income taxes subject to FAS 109. FIN 48 is effective
        for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company plans to
        adopt
        this guidance effective for fiscal year 2008. The Company does not expect
        the
        adoption of this interpretation to have a material impact on its financial
        position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Note
        2.       Cash
        and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments  

The
        Company manages its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
        jointly
        in order to internally fund operating needs. Short-term investments as of
        August
        31, 2005 consisted primarily of held-to-maturity time deposits, which were
        pledged as collateral for letters of credit.  

The
        Company's combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance
        increased to $9.7 million as of August 30, 2006, from $4.5 million as of
        August
        31, 2005. The increase was primarily attributed to cash flows from operations
        and $8.0 million in proceeds from property held for sale, offset by purchases
        of
        assets of approximately $15.9 million and net debt repayments of $13.5
        million. 

29 

Note
        3.       Income
        Taxes  

The
        following is a summarization of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
        as of
        the current and prior fiscal year-end: 

30 

The
        following table details the categories of income tax assets and liabilities
        resulting from the cumulative tax effects of temporary differences as of
        the end
        of each period presented: 

Relative
        only to continuing operations, the reconciliation of the expense (benefit)
        for
        income taxes to the expected income tax expense (benefit), computed using
        the
        statutory tax rate, was as follows:  

31 

For
        the
        fiscal year ended August 30, 2006,   including
        both continuing and discontinued operations, the Company generated gross
        taxable
        income of approximately $12.4 million, which will be offset by net operating
        loss carryforwards from prior years. Current income taxes incurred consisted
        of
        income tax expense for the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) liability of
        approximately $251,000 for fiscal  2006. The AMT liability may be used as a
        credit in the future if regular income tax exceeds future AMT. No current
        income
        tax was incurred during fiscal year 2004. 

For
        the
        fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, including both continuing and discontinued
        operations, the Company generated gross taxable income of approximately $3.0
        million which was offset by net operating loss carryforwards from prior years.
        However, the Company  incurred an AMT liability of approximately $90,000
        for fiscal year 2005. The AMT liability may be used as a credit in the future
        if
        regular income tax exceeds future AMT. 

For
        fiscal years 2004 and 2003, including both continuing and discontinued
        operations, the Company generated net operating loss carryforwards of
        approximately $4.0 million and $31.7 million, respectively, which will fully
        expire in 2024 and 2023, respectively, if not utilized. The balance of the
        net
        operating loss carryovers at the end of fiscal year 2005 was approximately
        $32.3
        million; however, as described below, the net operating loss carryforwards
        were
        reduced as a result of an IRS audit. At the end of fiscal 2006, remaining
        federal net operating loss carryovers were approximately $12.5
        million. 
 
        The
        tax
        benefits of the operating losses and other deferred tax assets for book purposes
        in fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were netted against a valuation allowance because
        loss carrybacks were exhausted with the fiscal 2002 tax filing and the future
        realization of loss carryforwards and the reversal of deferred tax assets
        were
        uncertain. For book purposes after fiscal year 2004, tax expense and benefits
        were offset against the valuation allowance. Tax benefits of $2.9 million
        in
        fiscal 2004 and $1.4 million in fiscal 2003 were realized as a result of
        reductions in our income tax valuation allowance by the equivalent amount
        that
        our deferred tax liabilities increased as a result of the adoption of EITF
        05-8
 Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a Beneficial
        Conversion Feature .  

Because
        of the Company s continued financial profitability and expected future results
        of operations, it was determined in fiscal year 2006 that it is now more
        likely
        than not that these tax assets are realizable and, accordingly, they were
        recognized as provided under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No. 109
 Accounting for Income Taxes.  Consequently, during fiscal 2006, the Company
        offset $4.5 million in fiscal 2006 tax expenses against the valuation
        allowance. The remaining balance of the valuation allowance was reversed as
        the Company recognized a previously unrecognized non-cash income tax benefit
        of
        approximately $4.8 million, which includes a $1.5 million favorable adjustment
        to that portion of the valuation allowance that had previously been reserved
        for
        the estimated settlemet of the fiscal 2003 IRS audit discussed
        below. 

The
        Company's federal income tax returns have been periodically reviewed by the
        Internal Revenue Service. The Company's 2002, 2001, and 2000 returns are
        currently under review. The IRS review may possibly result in a reduction
        of the
        deductions claimed on the returns and additional income taxes due. In August
        2006, the Company settled an IRS audit of the 2003 fiscal year and agreed
        to a
        partial reduction of the loss claimed on the federal income tax return for
        the
        year. The result of the audit was a reduction of $7.4 million in the cumulative
        net operating losses carried forward to offset future taxable income. The
        total
        net operating losses being carried forward after the IRS audit adjustment
        is
        approximately $12.5 million. 

Management
        believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been reflected in
        the
        financial statements and is not aware of any significant exposure items that
        have not been reflected in the financial statements. Amounts considered probable
        of settlement within one year have been included in the accrued expenses
        and
        other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The
        cost
        and accumulated depreciation of property and equipment at August 30, 2006
        and
        August 31, 2005, together with the related estimated useful lives used in
        computing depreciation and amortization, were as follows: 

During
        fiscal 2006, the Company reviewed the status of restaurant equipment located
        at
        all of its restaurants and the capitalized restaurant equipment inventory
        at its
        Houston Service Center. In conducting this review, the Company evaluated
        the
        condition, location and usefulness of all such assets with respect to their
        valuation reflected in the Company s consolidated statement of financial
        position. As a result of this evaluation, the Company recorded asset
        retirements, reducing property and equipment by $11.0 million in gross book
        value and $1.3 million in net book value in fiscal 2006. The resulting $1.3
        million charge was reflected in the net loss/(gain) on disposition of property
        and equipment line item in the Consolidated Statement of
        Operations.

Note
        7.       Debt  

Previous
        Senior Debt   

        During
        the mid-1990's, the Company entered into a revolving line-of-credit with
        a group
        of four banks. The line was primarily used for financing long-term objectives,
        including capital acquisitions and a stock repurchase program. These large
        demands of cash contributed to the capacity under that line-of-credit being
        fully exhausted in fiscal 2001, at which time the Company received an additional
        $10.0 million in subordinate financing from its Chief Executive Officer and
        Chief Operating Officer (see     Subordinated
        Notes  below). 

In
        the
        fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company successfully refinanced its existing
        senior credit facility with two new instruments. The first was a secured,
        three-year line of credit for $50.0 million. Of the total line, only $36.3
        million was originally drawn in connection with the refinancing. This instrument
        was funded by a new syndicate of four independent banks.  
 
        In
        addition to the line of credit, the Company concurrently negotiated another
        secured, three-year term loan for $27.9 million. The term loan was funded
        by a
        third-party financial institution not related to any member of the bank group
        that funded the line of credit. 

Primarily
        proceeds from property sales of under performing units, along with cash flows
        from operations and new financing were used to pay down all remaining debt
        under
        the term loan through August 31, 2005. 

Revolving
        Credit Facility   

        On
        August
        31, 2005, Luby s, Inc. entered into an amended and restated, $45.0 million
        unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) among
        Luby s, Inc. and a syndicate of three independent banks. The Revolving Credit
        Facility may, subject to certain terms and conditions, be increased by an
        additional $15.0 million for a total facility size of $60.0 million. The
        Revolving Credit Facility allows for up to $10.0 million of the available
        credit
        to be extended in the form of letters of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility
        terminates, and all amounts owing thereunder must be repaid, on August 31,
        2008. 

At
        any
        time throughout the term of the facility, the Company has the option to elect
        one of two bases of interest rates. One interest rate option is the greater
        of
        (a) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, or (b) prime, plus, in either
        case, an applicable spread that ranges from 0% to 0.25% per annum. The other
        interest rate option is LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate) plus an applicable
        spread that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum. The applicable spread under
        each option is dependent upon certain measures of the Company s financial
        performance at the time of election. 

The
        Company also pays a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused portion
        of the
        Revolving Credit Facility, which is also dependent upon the Company s financial
        performance, ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% per annum. The Company also is
        obligated to pay certain fees in respect of any letters of credit issued
        as well
        as an administrative fee to the lender acting as administrative agent. Finally,
        the Company was obligated to pay to the lenders a one-time fee in connection
        with the closing of the Revolving Credit Facility. 

34 

The
        Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on
        the
        Company s ability to engage in certain activities, including financial
        performance covenants and limitations on capital expenditures, asset sales
        and
        acquisitions, and contains customary events of default. As of November 3,
        2006,
        the Company was in full compliance with all covenants. 

All
        amounts owed by Luby s, Inc. under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed
        by its subsidiaries. 

The
        Company s total outstanding debt, if any, is due and payable on August 31, 2008,
        under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. As of August 30, 2006 and
        August 31, 2005, the total debt outstanding was $0.0 and $13.5 million,
        respectively. As of August 30, 2006, $39.9 million was available for
        borrowing. 

At
        August
        30, 2006, the Company had a total of approximately $5.1 million committed
        under
        letters of credit which have been issued as security for the payment of
        insurance obligations classified as accrued expenses on the balance sheet.
        The
        available amount, to be issued under letters of credit, was $4.9 million.

Subordinated
        Notes   

        In
        the
        fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the Company's President and Chief Executive
        Officer, Christopher J. Pappas, and the Company's Chief Operating Officer,
        Harris J. Pappas, loaned the Company a total of $10.0 million in exchange
        for
        convertible subordinated notes. The notes, as initially executed, bore interest
        at LIBOR plus 2.0%, payable quarterly. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
        2004,
        these notes were modified in connection with the refinancing of the Company s
        senior debt.  
 
        On
        June
        7, 2005, the subordinated notes became convertible at a price of $3.10 per
        share
        for approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock. The market price of
        the
        Company's common stock on the commitment date (as determined by the closing
        price on the New York Stock Exchange) was $5.63 per share. The difference
        between the market price and the lowest possible strike price of $3.10, or
        $2.53
        per share, multiplied by the relative number of convertible shares equals
        approximately $8.2 million, which represents the beneficial conversion feature.
        This amount was recorded as both a component of paid-in capital and a discount
        from the $10.0 million in subordinated notes. The note discount was being
        amortized using the effective interest method as non-cash interest expense
        over
        the original term of the subordinated notes. On August 30, 2005 the notes
        were
        converted into 3.2 million shares of the Company s common stock, under the terms
        of the amended note agreements discussed further herein. Upon conversion,
        the
        unamortized book value of the discount of $8.0 million was written off with
        a
        charge to interest expense. 

The
        shares issued pursuant to the conversion were treasury shares that had
        previously been reserved for such a conversion. At conversion, the excess
        of the
        book value of the treasury shares of $69.0 million over the $10 million debt
        converted resulted in a $59.0 million charge to retained earnings.  

Interest
        Expense    

        Total
        interest expense incurred for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $1.2 million, $14.4
        million and $10.3 million, respectively. Interest paid approximated $0.8
        million, $4.1 million and $7.9 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
        respectively.  

Interest
        expense of approximately $0.1 million, $2.7 million, and $2.2 million in
        fiscal
        years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively, has been allocated to discontinued
        operations based upon the debt that was required to be repaid as a result
        of the
        disposal transactions. After the initiation of the debt refinancing in the
        fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, only the interest relating to the term loan
        is
        reclassified to discontinued operations. No interest was capitalized on
        qualifying properties in 2006, 2005 or 2004.

Note
        8.       Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets and Store Closings /Discontinued Operations

Impairment
        of Long-Lived Assets and Store Closings   

        In
        accordance with Company guidelines, management periodically reviews the
        financial performance of each store for indicators of impairment or indicators
        that closure would be appropriate. Where indicators are present, such as
        three
        full fiscal years of negative cash flows or other unfavorable market conditions,
        the carrying values of assets are written down to the estimated future
        discounted cash flows or fully written off in the case of negative cash flows
        anticipated in the future. Estimated future cash flows are based upon regression
        analyses generated from similar Company restaurants, discounted at the Company's
        weighted-average cost of capital. 

Estimated
        lease settlements under the Company s 2001 disposal plan were originally charged
        to expense under  Provision for Asset Impairments and Restaurant Closings. 
Subsequent adjustments to these lease settlements for actual exit costs incurred
        are also reflected in the  Provision for Asset Impairments and Restaurant
        Closings.  

The
        Company recognized the following impairment (credits)/charges to income from
        operations: 

Discontinued
        Operations   

        From
        the
        inception of the Company s business plan in fiscal 2003 through the plan's
        completion as of August 30, 2006, the Company has closed 64 operating stores.
        The operating results of these locations have been reclassified and reported
        as
        discontinued operations for all periods presented as required by Statement
        of
        Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or
        Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.  SFAS No. 144 establishes a single accounting
        model for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sales and broadens the
        presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions.
        The Company adopted SFAS No. 144 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, as
        required. The following table sets forth the sales and pretax losses reported
        for all discontinued locations: 

36 

Pursuant
        to the Company s business plan, the Company has continued to apply the proceeds
        from the sale of closed restaurants to pay down its senior debt. Of the total
        paid down in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, $3.6 million, $13.4 million and
        $15.3
        million, respectively, resulted from sales proceeds related to business plan
        assets. Proceeds from the sale of properties held for sale as of August 30,
        2006, may also be applied to pay down senior debt, if any, but under the
        terms
        of the Company s new credit facility, there is no requirement to do
        so. 

In
        accordance with EITF 87-24,  Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations, 
interest on debt that is required to be repaid as a result of a disposal
        transaction should be allocated to discontinued operations. For fiscal 2006,
        2005 and 2004, approximately $137,000, $2.7 million and $2.2 million,
        respectively, were allocated to discontinued operations. The basis of the
        allocation to discontinued operations was an application of the credit
        facility's historical effective interest rates to the portion of the estimated
        total debt that equals the amount related to current and future business
        plan
        disposals as explained in the previous paragraph. 

Relative
        to the business plan, as the Company has formally settled lease terminations
        or
        has reached definitive agreements to terminate leases, the related charges
        have
        been recorded. For fiscal 2006 and 2005, no lease exit costs associated with
        the
        business plan met these criteria and, consequently, were not accrued as of
        that
        date. Furthermore, the Company did not accrue future rental costs in instances
        where locations closed; however, management has the ability to sublease at
        amounts equal to or greater than the rental costs. The Company does not accrue
        employee settlement costs; these charges are expensed as incurred. 

The
        following table summarizes discontinued operations for fiscal  2006, 2005,
        and 2004: 

Within
        discontinued operations, the Company offsets gains from applicable property
        disposals against total impairments as described above. The amounts in the
        table
        described as Other include allocated interest, lease settlements, employment
        termination and shut-down costs, as well as operating losses through each
        restaurant's closing date and carrying costs until the locations are finally
        disposed of.  

The
        impairment charges included above relate to properties closed and designated
        for
        immediate disposal. The assets of these individual operating units have been
        written down to their net realizable values. In turn, the related properties
        have either been sold or are being actively marketed for sale. All dispositions
        are expected to be completed within one year. Within discontinued operations,
        the Company also recorded the related fiscal year-to-date net operating results,
        allocated interest expense, employee terminations, lease settlements, and
        basic
        carrying costs of the closed units.

Property
        Held for Sale    

        At
        August
        30, 2006, the Company had a total of three properties recorded at approximately
        $1.7 million in property held for sale. Of the three properties remaining,
        one
        is related to prior disposal plans. On August 31, 2005, the Company had a
        total
        of thirteen properties recorded at $9.3 million in property held for sale.
        Two
        properties were reclassified from property held for sale to property, plant
        and
        equipment during the first quarter fiscal year 2006. These reclassified
        properties are intended to be used to support operations. During fiscal year
        2006, eight properties were sold. 

The
        Company is actively marketing the locations currently classified as property
        held for sale. Property held for sale consists primarily of already-closed
        restaurant properties. Property held for sale is valued at the lower of net
        depreciable value or net realizable value. 

The
        Company s results of discontinued operations will be affected to the extent
        proceeds from the sales exceed or are less than net book value. 

A
        rollforward of property held for sale for fiscal 2006 and 2005 is provided
        below
   (in
        thousands):  

Note
        9.       Commitments
        and Contingencies   

Off-Balance-Sheet
        Arrangements   

        The
        Company has no off-balance-sheet structured financing arrangements.

Pending
        Claims   

        The
        Company presently, and from time to time, is subject to pending claims and
        lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of
        management, the resolution of any pending legal proceedings will not have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company's operations or consolidated financial
        position. 

Surety
        Bonds   

        By
        February 15, 2006, the Company replaced the $5 million in surety bonds with
        letters of credit under the Company s Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 7,
 Debt , above. This replacement allowed for a reduction in the required amount
        of security to cover the estimated insurance obligations and provide the
        Company
        with a more cost-effective collateral option as security for these
        obligations. 

Note
        10.       Operating
        Leases  

The
        Company conducts part of its operations from facilities that are leased under
        noncancelable lease agreements. Approximately 88% of the leases contain renewal
        options ranging from one to thirty years.  

Most
        leases include periodic escalation clauses. Accordingly, the Company follows
        the
        straight-line rent method of recognizing lease rental expense, as prescribed

        SFAS No. 13,  Accounting for Leases.  

In
        fiscal
        2005, the Company entered into noncancelable operating lease agreements for
        certain office equipment, with terms ranging from 48 to 60 months. 

38 

Annual
        future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with terms
        in
        excess of one year as of August 30, 2006, are as follows:  

Most
        of
        the leases are for periods of ten to twenty-five years and provide for
        contingent rentals based on sales in excess of a base amount. Total rent
        expense
        for operating leases for the last three fiscal years was as follows:

See
        Note
        12,  Related Parties , below for lease payments associated with related
        parties. 

Sales
        and Leaseback   

        In
        June
        2004, the Company executed a sale and leaseback of land and improvements
        at one
        of its Corpus Christi locations with a third party buyer. This particular
        location featured a restaurant, as well as additional shopping center space
        leased to tenants. The Company sold the entire property but only leased back
        the
        restaurant. The terms of the lease provide for a primary term of five years
        commencing July 1, 2005, a basic monthly rental of $7,500. The lease also
        provides for two five-year renewal option periods. 

Proceeds
        received on the sale of the property totaled $2.85 million and the total
        gain on
        the property was $2.37 million. In accordance with FAS 13, the present value
        of
        the minimum lease payments, an amount totaling $395,000, was booked as a
        deferred rent liability to be amortized over the five-year primary term life
        of
        the lease. The remaining balance of the gain, $1.98 million, was recognized
        as
        other income in fiscal year 2004. 

Note

        Benefit Plans and Agreements  

Stock
        Options   

        The
        Company has an Executive Stock Option Plan as well as Incentive Stock Plans
        for
        officers and employees together ( Employee Stock Plans ) and a Non-employee
        Director Stock Option Plan for non-employee directors. These plans authorize
        the
        granting of stock options, restricted stock, and other types of awards
        consistent with the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized
        for
        issuance under the Company's plans as of August 30, 2006 totals approximately
        5.2 million, of which approximately 2.1 million shares are available for
        future
        issuance. Stock options granted under the Incentive Stock Plans and the
        Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan have an exercise price equal to the
        market price of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. Option awards
        under the Executive Stock Option Plan vest 50% on the first anniversary of
        the
        grant date, 25% on the second anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining
        25% on the third anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years from
        the
        grant date. Option awards under the Employee Stock Plans generally vest 25%
        each
        year on the anniversary of the grant date and expire six to ten years from
        the
        grant date. Option awards under the Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan
        generally vest 100% on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire
        ten
        years from the grant date. 

39 

In
        connection with their employment agreements effective March 9, 2001, the
        CEO and
        the COO were granted approximately 2.2 million stock options at a strike
        price
        of $5.00 per share, which was below the quoted market price on the date of
        grant. From that date through the end of fiscal 2004, the Company recognized
        a
        total of $5.2 million in non-cash compensation expense associated with these
        options. Total expenses of $679,000 were recognized in fiscal 2004. The Company
        has listed on the New York Stock Exchange additional shares which would permit
        full exercise of the options. As of November 3, 2006, neither the Chief
        Executive Officer nor the Chief Operating Office has exercised any of these
        options. 

Effective
        September 1, 2005, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions
        of
        SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective method. Under this method,
        compensation cost in fiscal 2006 includes the portion of awards vesting in
        the
        period for (a) all share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested
        as of
        August 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
        with
        the original provisions of SFAS No.123 and (b) all share-based payments granted
        subsequent to August 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated
        using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Before adoption of SFAS No.
        123R,
        pro forma disclosures reflected the fair value of each option grant estimated
        on
        the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the
        following weighted-average assumptions: 

Results
        of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts, and the Company had
        no
        cumulative effect adjustment upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R under the modified
        prospective method. The Company's policy is to recognize compensation cost
        for
        awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight
        line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.  

The
        adoption of SFAS No. 123R increased general and administrative expenses,
        thereby
        decreasing the Company's reported operating income, income before income
        taxes
        and reported net income for fiscal year 2006 by approximately $386,000, and
        reduced both basic and diluted net income per share by $0.01. The expense,
        before income tax effect, is reflected in general and administrative expenses.
        The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 123R did not affect operating income,
        income
        before income taxes, net income, cash flow from operations, cash flow from
        financing activities, or basic and diluted net income per share in the
        comparable periods of fiscal years 2005 and 2004. 

Prior
        to
        August 31, 2005, the Company accounted for its stock based compensation under
        the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board
        ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related
        interpretations, the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
        for
        Stock-Based Compensation" and the disclosures required by SFAS No. 148,
        "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure." In
        accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, no stock-based compensation cost was
        reflected in the Company's prior year net income for grants of stock options
        to
        employees because the Company granted stock options with an exercise price
        equal
        to the market value of the stock on the date of grant. The reported stock
        based
        compensation expense, net of related tax effects, in the table below represents
        compensation costs associated with restricted stock grants.  

40 

If
        the
        Company had used the fair value based accounting method for stock compensation
        expense prescribed by SFAS Nos. 123 and 148 for fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
        the
        Company's consolidated net income and net income per share would have been
        decreased to the pro-forma amounts illustrated as follows: 

(a)   Income
        taxes were offset by a valuation allowance. See Note 3,  Income Taxes , above.

Partly
        in
        anticipation of the adoption of SFAS No.123R, in recent years the Company
        has
        adjusted the mix of employee long-term incentive compensation by reducing
        stock
        options awarded and increasing certain cash-based compensation and other
        equity
        based awards. Compensation cost for share-based payment arrangements recognized
        in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 was approximately
        $386,000 for stock options and $49,000 for restricted stock. The total income
        tax effect of these expenses was offset by a valuation allowance and, therefore,
        no benefit was recognized in the income statement for fiscal 2006 for
        share-based compensation arrangements. 

The
        fair
        value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
        Black-Scholes option pricing model, which determines inputs as shown in the
        following table. Because of differences in option terms and historical exercise
        patterns among the plans, the Company has segregated option awards into three
        homogenous groups for the purpose of determining fair values for its options.
        Valuation assumptions are determined separately for the three groups which
        represent, respectively, the Executive Stock Option Plan, the Employee Stock
        Plans and the Non-employee Director Stock Option Plan. The assumptions are
        as
        follows: 

The
                Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance
                over the expected life of the option. Management considered the guidance
                in SFAS No. 123R and believes the historical estimated volatility
                is
                materially indicative of expectations about expected future
                volatility. 

The
                Company uses the simplified method outlined in SEC Staff Accounting
                Bulletin No. 107 to estimate expected lives for options granted during
                the
                period. 

The
                risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve
                in
                effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option.

The
                expected dividend yield is based on the Company's current dividend
                yield
                and the best estimate of projected dividend yield for future periods
                within the expected life of the
                option.

A
        summary
        of the Company's stock option activity for the three years ended August 30,
        2006, August 31, 2005 and August 25, 2004 is presented in the following
        table: 

The
        weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal year
        2006 was $  6.72
          per
        share. The intrinsic value for stock options is defined as the difference
        between the current market value and the grant price. The total intrinsic
        value
        of options exercised during fiscal 2006 was approximately $  496,000  . 

Exercise
        prices for options outstanding as of August 30, 2006, range from $1.98 to
        $17.125 per share. The weighted-average remaining contractual life of these
        options is 4.39 years. Excluding 2,240,000 executive stock options with an
        exercise price of $5.00 per share, the exercisable options as of August 30,
        2006, have a weighted-average exercise price of $6.987 per share. 

During
        fiscal year 2006, cash received from options exercised was approximately
        $1.1
        million,     and
        the
        calculated but unrecognized tax benefit for the tax deductions from stock
        options exercised totaled approximately $  173,000  .

Options
        Outstanding and Exercisable by Price Range  

         As
        of August 30, 2006  

At
        August
        30, 2006 and August 31, 2005, the number of incentive stock option shares
        available to be granted under the plans was 1,875,000 and 1,907,250 shares,
        respectively.  

Restricted
        Stock      

Restricted
          stock grants consist of the Company's common stock and generally   vest
          after three years, with the exception of current grants under the Nonemployee
          Director Stock Option Plan, which vest when granted due to the fact that
          they
          are granted in lieu of a cash payment. All restricted stock grants are
          cliff-vested. Restricted stock awards are valued at the average market
          price of
          the Company's common stock at the date of grant. 

A
        summary
        of the Company's restricted stock activity during the fiscal year 2006 is
        presented in the following table: 

At
        August
        30, 2006, there was approximately $  1.4
          million
        of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based
        compensation arrangements that is expected to be recognized over a
        weighted-average period of 2.75 years.  

43 

Supplemental
        Executive Retirement Plan       

The
          Company has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ) designed to
          provide benefits for selected officers at normal retirement age with 25
          years of
          service equal to 50% of their final average compensation offset by Social
          Security, profit sharing benefits, and deferred compensation. Some of the
          officers designated to participate in the plan have retired and are receiving
          benefits under the plan. Accrued benefits of all actively employed participants
          become fully vested upon termination of the plan or a change in control
          (as
          defined in the plan). The plan is unfunded, and the Company is obligated
          to make
          benefit payments solely on a current disbursement basis. None of the named
            executive
          officers participate in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. On
          December
          6, 2005, the Board of Directors voted to amend the SERP and suspend the
          further
          accrual of benefits and participation. 

As
        a
        result a curtailment gain of approximately $88,000 was recognized, as required
        under the provisions of FASB Statement No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for
        Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for
        Termination Benefits". The net benefit recognizes for this plan for the years
        ended August 30, 2006, August 31, 2005, and August 25, 2004 was approximately
        $86,000, $129,000, and $188,000, respectively, and the unfunded accrued
        liability included in  Other Liabilities  on the Company s consolidated balance
        sheet as of August 30, 2006 and August 31, 2005 was approximately $229,000
        and
        $337,000, respectively.  

Nonemployee
        Director Phantom Stock Plan   

        Under
        the
        Company s Nonemployee Director Phantom Stock Plan ( Phantom Stock Plan ),
        nonemployee directors deferred portions of their retainer and meeting fees
        which, along with certain matching incentives, were credited to phantom stock
        accounts in the form of phantom shares priced at the market value of the
        Company s common stock on the date of grant. Additionally, the phantom stock
        accounts were credited with dividends, if any, paid on the common stock
        represented by phantom shares. Authorized shares (100,000 shares) under the
        Phantom Stock Plan were fully depleted in early fiscal year 2003 and as such,
        no
        deferrals, incentives or dividends have been credited to phantom stock accounts
        since then. As participants cease to be directors, their phantom shares are
        converted into an equal number of shares of common stock and issued from
        the
        Company s treasury stock. As of August 30, 2006, approximately 29,600 phantom
        shares remained unissued under the Phantom Stock Plan. 

401(k)
        Plan   

        The
        Company has a voluntary 401(k) employee savings plan to provide substantially
        all employees of the Company an opportunity to accumulate personal funds
        for
        their retirement. These contributions may be made on a pre-tax basis to the
        plan, and the Company matches 25% of participants' contributions of up to
        4% of
        their salary. The net expense recognized in connection with the employer
        match
        feature of the voluntary 401(k) employee savings plan for the years ended
        August
        30, 2006, August 31, 2005, and August 25, 2004, was $178,000, $192,000, and
        $201,000, respectively. 

Deferred
        Compensation Plans   

        During
        1999, the Company established a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for
        highly compensated executives which was terminated in fiscal 2004. The plan
        allowed deferral of a portion of annual salary and up to 100% of bonuses
        before
        taxes. The Company did not match any deferral amounts and retained ownership
        of
        all assets until distributed. The funds from the terminated plan were
        distributed in fiscal 2004.  

The
        Company continues to make payments to former employees or their beneficiaries
        under a previous plan that provides retirement, death, and disability benefits
        for certain highly compensated executives. All benefits under this plan were
        fully accrued prior to fiscal year 2000, and future benefits payable amount
        to
        approximately $91,000 at August 30, 2006. 

Profit
        Sharing Plan   

        In
        fiscal
        2004, the Company terminated its profit sharing and retirement plan (the
 Plan )
        and is in the process of making distributions to all Plan participants. The
        Plan
        covered substantially all employees who had attained the age of 21 years
        and had
        completed one year of continuous service. It was administered by a corporate
        trustee, was a  qualified plan  under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
        Code, and provided for the payment of the employee's vested portion of the
        Plan
        upon retirement, termination, disability, or death. The Plan had been funded
        by
        contributions of a portion of the net earnings of the Company and was amended
        effective August 31, 2001 to make all contributions discretionary. No annual
        contributions to the Plan were made in fiscal 2006, 2005, or
        2004.

        Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, Christopher
        J.
        Pappas and Harris J. Pappas, respectively, own two restaurant entities (the
         Pappas entities ) that may provide services to Luby's, Inc. as detailed in the
        Affiliate Services Agreement and the Master Sales Agreement. Under the terms
        of
        the Affiliate Services Agreement, the Pappas entities may provide accounting,
        architectural, and general business services. No costs were incurred relative
        to
        the Affiliate Services Agreement in fiscal 2006. The total costs incurred
        relative to the Affiliate Services Agreements, which expired on December
        31,
        2005, were $5,000 and $1,000 in fiscal 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

Under
        the
        terms of the Master Sales Agreement, the Pappas entities may provide specialized

Operating
        Leases   

        The
        Company also entered into a three-year lease which commenced on June 1, 2001
        and
        expired on May 31, 2004. This lease is currently effective on a month-to-month
        basis. The leased property, referred to as the Houston Service Center, is
        used
        to accommodate the Company's own in-house repair and fabrication center.
        The
        Company paid approximately $82,000, $88,000, and $82,000, in fiscal 2006,
        2005,
        and 2004, respectively, pursuant to the terms of this lease. 

The
        Company previously leased from an unrelated third party a location used to
        house
        increased equipment inventories due to store closures under the business
        plan.
        The Company considered it more prudent to lease this location rather than
        to
        pursue purchasing a storage facility, as its strategy is to focus its capital
        expenditures on its operating restaurants. In a separate transaction, the
        third-party property owner sold the location to the Pappas entities during
        the
        fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, with the Pappas entities becoming the Company's
        landlord for that location effective August 1, 2003. The storage site
        complements the Houston Service Center with approximately 27,000 square feet
        of
        warehouse space at an approximate monthly rate of $0.21 per square foot.
        The
        Company paid approximately $67,000, $72,000 and $69,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005
        and
        2004, respectively, pursuant to the terms of this lease. 

In
        the
        third quarter of fiscal 2004, Christopher J. and Harris J. Pappas became
        partners in a limited partnership which purchased a retail strip center in
        Houston, Texas. Messrs. Pappas own a 50% limited partnership and a 50% general
        partnership interest. One of the Company's restaurants has rented approximately
        7% of the space in that center since July 1969. No changes were made to the
        Company's lease terms as a result of the transfer of ownership of the center
        to
        the new partnership. The Company paid approximately $266,000, $276,000 and
        $83,000 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, pursuant to the terms
        of
        this lease. 

Affiliated
        rents paid for the Houston Service Center, the separate storage facility,
        the
        Dallas property and the Houston property leases combined represented 9.8%,
        8.8%,
        and 5.6% of total rents for continuing operations for fiscal 2006, 2005,
        and
        2004, respectively.

Board
        of Directors   

        Pursuant
        to the terms of a separate Purchase Agreement dated March 9, 2001, entered
        into
        by and among the Company, Christopher J. Pappas and Harris J. Pappas, the
        Company agreed to submit three persons designated by Christopher J. Pappas
        and
        Harris J. Pappas as nominees for election at the 2002 Annual Meeting of
        Shareholders. Messrs. Pappas designated themselves and Frank Markantonis
        as
        their nominees for directors, all of whom were subsequently elected. Christopher
        J. Pappas and Harris J. Pappas are brothers. As disclosed in the proxy statement
        for the February 26, 2004, annual meeting of shareholders, Frank Markantonis

Under
        the
        terms of the amended Purchase Agreement dated June 7, 2004, the right to
        nominate directors for election was modified to provide that Messrs. Pappas
        may
        continue to nominate persons for election to the board which, if such nominees
        are elected, would result in Messrs. Pappas having nominated three of the
        then-serving directors of the Company. Messrs. Pappas retain their right
        for so
        long as they both are executive officers of the Company.

        J. Pappas, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer, is a member of

Note
        13.       Common
        Stock   

In
        1991,
        the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend
        of one common stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock.
        The rights are not initially exercisable. The Company amended the Shareholder
        Rights Plan effective February 27, 2004, to extend the expiration date to
        April
        16, 2007. The rights may become exercisable under circumstances described
        in the
        plan if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or more of
        the
        common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer, the completion of which
        would result in the ownership by a person or group of 15% or more of the
        common
        stock (either, an  Acquiring Person ). Once the rights become exercisable, each
        right will be exercisable to purchase, for $27.50 (the  Purchase Price ),
        one-half of one share of common stock, par value $0.32 per share, of the
        Company. If any person becomes an Acquiring Person, each right will entitle
        the
        holder, other than the Acquiring Person, to acquire for the Purchase Price
        a
        number of shares of the Company's common stock having a market value of four
        times the Purchase Price.  

In
        connection with the employment of Christopher J. Pappas, the Company's President
        and Chief Executive Officer, and Harris J. Pappas, the Company's Chief Operating
        Officer, the Shareholder Rights Plan, as amended, exempts from the operation
        of
        the plan Messrs. Pappas' ownership of the Company's common stock to March
        8,
        2001 (and certain additional shares permitted to be acquired), shares acquired
        upon their election to convert the subordinated notes on August 31, 2005,
        and
        certain shares of common stock which may be acquired in connection with options
        issued on the date of their employment. 

The
        Company has approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock reserved for
        issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. 

46 

Treasury
        Shares   

        The
        Company's treasury shares are reserved for two purposes: the issuance of
        shares
        to Messrs. Pappas upon exercise of the options granted to them on March 9,
        2001,
        and the issuance of shares under the Company's Nonemployee Director Phantom
        Stock Plan. The Company has listed on the New York Stock Exchange additional
        shares to permit full exercise of Messrs. Pappas options.

        Share Information  

A
        reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of basic earnings per share
        and earnings per share assuming dilution is shown in the table below:

        in fiscal 2006, 3,219,000 shares in fiscal 2005, and 2,216,000 in fiscal
        2004
        (including the dilutive effect of the convertible subordinated notes).
        Additionally, stock options with exercise prices exceeding current market
        prices
        that were excluded from the computation of net income (loss) per share amounted
        to 207,000 shares in fiscal 2006, 484,000 shares in fiscal 2005, and 2,495,000
        shares in fiscal 2004.

Note
        16.       Subsequent
        Events  

On
        October 19, 2006, pursuant to the Luby s Incentive Stock Plan, the Company s
        Board of Directors approved grants of options to purchase shares of the
        Company s common stock for the following executive officers: Christopher J.
        Pappas, President and Chief Executive Officer (86,089 options); Harris J.
        Pappas, Chief Operating Officer (86,089 options); Ernest Pekmezaris, Senior
        Vice
        President and Chief Financial Officer (23,658 options); and Peter Tropoli,
        Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary (23,658 options). The
        exercise price of each stock option is $10.18, the closing market price on
        the
        date of the grant, and the options vest and become exercisable in equal
        installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant.
        Vested options must be exercised within six years of the grant
        date. 

The
        Board
        also approved grants of the Company s common stock in the form of restricted
        stock. Mr. Pekmezaris received 3,286 shares of restricted stock, and Mr.
        Tropoli
        received 3,154 shares of restricted stock. The restricted stock fully vests
        and
        becomes unrestricted on October 19, 2009. The restricted stock is valued
        at the
        closing price of the Company s common stock of $10.18 per share on October 19,
        2006. If not vested, the restricted stock will automatically expire and
        terminate, and will be forfeited to the Company, on the date that the grantee s
        employment is terminated, except upon retirement on or after the grantee s
        65   th   
        birthday, death, permanent and total disability, a leave of absence by the
        grantee or a change of control of the Company, as defined in the award

                  recent
                  fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
                  to

                  reporting.

                  to
                  the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of registrant's

                  functions): 

a) 

All
                  significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
                  or
                  operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
                  reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
                  to record,
                  process, summarize and report financial information;
                  and 

b) 

Any
                  fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
                  employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
                  control
                  over financial reporting.

 EXHIBIT 99.A CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES OF LUBY'S, INC., AS AMENDED OCTOBER 28, 2004.

Exhibit 99.a Corporate Governance Guidelines of Luby's, Inc., as amended October
      28, 2004.

Approved
      10/28/04  

       LUBY S,
      INC.  

         CORPORATE
      GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES   

ROLE
      AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF BOARD  

1.     Ethical
      Business Environment 

      The
      Board
      of Directors (the  Board ) of Luby s, Inc. ( Luby s  or the  company ) believes
      that the long-term success of Luby s largely depends on the maintenance of an
      ethical business environment that focuses on adherence to both the letter and
      spirit of the law and regulations and the highest standards of corporate
      citizenship. 

2.     Oversight 

      The
      Board
      acknowledges that Luby s has many different stakeholders. However, the paramount
      duty of the Board and management is to the shareholders; the interests of other
      stakeholders are relevant as a derivative of the duty to shareholders. The
      Board
      is the ultimate decision-making body except for those matters reserved by law
      to
      the shareholders. The company s management team is charged by the Board with the
      management of Luby s affairs. The Board monitors corporate performance against
      business plans on a regular basis to evaluate whether the business is being
      properly managed.  

3.     Senior
      Management 

      The
      Board
      has the responsibility to select, evaluate the performance of, and make
      decisions about the retention of, the chief executive officer. The appointment
      and regular evaluation of a chief operating officer, if any, and other executive
      officers will be made by the Board in collaboration with the chief executive
      officer. The Board, with the assistance of the Executive Compensation Committee,
      determines the chief executive officer s compensation and reviews and approves
      the salaries of senior executives. The Board, with the assistance of the
      Executive Compensation Committee, also reviews and approves management s
      recommendations for threshold, target and stretch points for the annual
      Incentive Bonus Plan. It periodically reviews succession planning and management
      development with the chief executive officer. The chief executive officer will
      report regularly to the Board on management development and succession planning.
      As part of this review, the chief executive officer will advise the Board as
      to
      his/her recommendation for a successor should he/she unexpectedly become
      disabled. The Board will seek, identify, evaluate, and appoint successors to
      the
      chief executive officer. 

4.     Strategy 

      The
      Board
      ensures that a strategic planning process is in place, is used, and produces
      sound choices. It reviews and approves major corporate strategies and monitors
      the imple-mentation of current strategic initiatives to assess whether they
      are
      on schedule, on budget, and producing effective results. The Board also approves
      the annual capital budget and is responsible for overseeing and understanding
      Luby s annual operating plans and annual budgets and for monitoring whether
      these plans are being implemented effectively and within budgetary limits.
      The
      Board evaluates the adequacy of the company s financial structure to support the
      major corporate strategies and recommends and approves changes when
      necessary.

5.     Material
      Transactions 

      The
      Board
      reviews and approves significant capital allocations and expenditures and
      material transactions not in the ordinary course of business. For example,
      the
      Board, through the Finance and Audit Committee, reviews and approves the
      issuance of debt and equity securities and the repurchase of the company s
      outstanding securities, and it also reviews and approves new bank lines of
      credit and significant changes thereto. 

6.     Internal
      Controls, Reporting, and Compliance 

      The
      Board
      satisfies itself as to the adequacy of internal controls, risk management,
      financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. 

7.     Nomination
      of Directors 

      The
      Board
      and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the  Governance
      Committee ) nominate directors to serve on the Board and ensure that the
      structure and practices of the Board provide for sound corporate
      governance 

8.     Selection
      and Oversight of Independent Auditors; Oversight of Financial
      Statements 

      The
      Finance and Audit Committee of the Board has the sole responsibility to appoint,
      compensate, and replace Luby s independent accounting firm that audits Luby s
      financial statements and to pre-approve the engagement terms and the provision
      of any audit and non-audit services performed by such accounting firm for
      Luby s. The Finance and Audit Committee has direct responsibility, and the Board
      has a corresponding and supplemental responsibility, for monitoring the
      performance of such accounting firm and guarding against any compromise of
      its
      independence, as well as overseeing the financial statements prepared by
      management, with the goal of assuring that they fairly present Luby s financial
      condition, results of operations, cash flows, and related risks in a clear
      and
      understandable way.

NEW
      DIRECTOR CANDIDATE SELECTION PROCESS  

9.     Membership
      Criteria 

      The
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending
      to
      the Board the appropriate skills and characteristics for prospective Board
      candidates in the context of the current Board makeup and the perceived needs
      of
      Luby s at that point in time. 

The

The
                size and existing composition of the

The
                number and qualifications of
                candidates 

The
                benefit of continuity on the Board 

The
                relevance of the candidate s background and experience to issues facing
                the Company. 

The
                outstanding achievement in their professional integrity, and their
                ability

                inquiries. 

The
                Company s present as well as future
                needs.

                demonstrated leadership, and significant experience in an area of
                endeavor

                Directors should be selected so that the Board has an appropriate

                integrity and have relevant expertise and experience, and be able

Directors
                should be financially literate and have a sound understanding of
                business
                strategy, business environment, corporate governance and Board
                operations.

                serve on
                the Board of another company whose interests are adverse to, or in

                interests;

                judgment;

                Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, for the purpose of serving on the Audit
                Committee. 

A
                majority of the Board of Directors must be comprised of  Independent 
                Directors, as that term is defined by the NYSE and/or the SEC;
                and. 

Maintain
                a Board that reflects diversity, including but not limited to gender,
                ethnicity and experience. 

10. 
      Screening, Selection, and Invitation to Serve 

      Luby s
      bylaws provide that director candidates standing for election by the
      shareholders shall be nominated by the Board or by a shareholder as provided
      in
      the bylaws. Vacancies in the Board shall be filled by selection of the current
      directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible
      for
      screening potential candidates with input from all Board members. The chairman
      will coordinate the extension of an invitation to Board membership. The
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ( Committee ) will generally use
      the following process when recruiting, evaluating and selecting new director
      candidates. Throughout the process, the Committee will keep the full Board
      informed of its progress. 

In
      the
      event that the Committee elects to proceed with a search for a new Director
      Candidate, the Committee will prepare a target candidate profile. 

The
      Committee will develop an initial list of Director Candidates by utilizing
      the
      personal network of the Board and Senior Management of the Company, and
      considering any previously recommended nominees. In addition, the committee
      may
      also retain a search firm to assist it in developing a list of director
      candidates. 

The
      Committee will screen the resulting slate of director candidates to identify
      individuals who best fit the target candidate profile and the guidelines for
      membership on the Board of Directors. From this review, the committee will
      prepare a list of preferred candidates and present it to the full Board and
      CEO
      for input. 

The
      Committee will designate an individual to initiate contact with the candidate
      to
      determine his or her interest in being considered for membership to the
      Board. 

The
      Chairman and at least one member of the Committee shall interview the
      prospective candidate. Reference checks shall also be performed. 

Based
      on
      input received from the candidate interviews, the Committee will determine
      whether to recommend the candidate to the full Board of Directors for
      membership. An effort will be made to introduce the candidate to the Board
      prior
      to his or her election. 

4 

The
      Board
      of Directors shall vote on whether to nominate the candidate for election to
      the
      Board, or in the case of vacancy on the Board, to elect the candidate to the
      Board. 

COMPOSITION
      OF THE BOARD  

11.     Independent
      Directors 

      A
      majority of the Board will be comprised of  independent  directors, as that term
      is defined from time to time by the listing standards of the New York Stock
      Exchange. In order to qualify a director as independent, the Board will
      affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with
      Luby s (either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an
      organization that has a relationship with Luby s). Luby s will disclose these
      determinations, as required by rules of the New York Stock Exchange. The term
       independent,  when used in these Guidelines, will have the definition specified
      from time to time in the listing standards of the New York Stock
      Exchange. 

12.     Number
      of
      Directors 

      The
      Board
      believes that the number of directors should not be less than nine or more
      than
      twelve. The Board may adjust the number upward to accommodate an outstanding
      potential candidate or during periods of transition when new directors may
      overlap with retiring directors. 

13.     Directors
      Who Change Principal Job Responsibility 

      Directors
      who have a significant change in their professional roles and responsibilities,
      such as retirement or a change in employer, should submit a letter to the
      chairman of the Board explaining the circumstances. The Board, through its
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, should review the circumstances
      and decide whether it is in the best interest of Luby s that the director
      continues to serve. 

14.     Retirement
      Age and Term Limits 

      A
      director shall not be eligible to stand for election or reelection to the Board
      after reaching the age of 70 years. A director will offer his or her resignation
      from the Board upon reaching the age of 70 years effective at the next annual
      meeting of shareholders. The Board has not established term limits for
      directors; however, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee should
      consider each director s contribution to the Board every three years, prior to
      his of her nomination for reelection. 

BOARD
      LEADERSHIP  

15.     Chairman/Chief
      Executive Officer 

      Corporate
      policy allows for separation of the office of chairman and chief executive
      officer. This policy is intended to preserve flexibility for the Board regarding
      the selection of chairman and chief executive officer and the independence
      of
      those positions. 

5 

16.     Presiding
      Independent Director 

      If
      the
      offices of the chief executive officer and chairman are not separate or, for
      any
      other reason, the chairman is not independent, the independent directors will
      elect one of their number to serve as a continuing presiding independent
      director. The presiding independent director will chair meetings of independent
      directors, will facilitate communications between other members of the Board
      and
      the chief executive officer and chairman, and will assume other duties which
      the
      independent directors as a whole may designate from time to time. The presiding
      independent director also may be responsible for representing the non-management
      directors or independent directors with respect to certain matters as to which
      the views of the non-management or independent directors are sought pursuant
      to
      specific provisions of these Guidelines or otherwise in a manner consistent
      with
      these Guidelines. Directors are always free to communicate directly with the
      chief executive officer and chairman. The name of the presiding independent
      director, if there is one, will be disclosed in Luby s annual proxy statement to
      facilitate communications by shareholders and employees with the non-management
      directors. 

17.     Limitations
      on Tenure as Independent Chair or Lead Director 

      An
      independent chair or presiding independent director serves at the pleasure
      of
      the Board. It is the sense of the Board that a director s service as independent
      chair or presiding independent director should generally not extend beyond
      the
      annual meeting of shareholders after three consecutive years of
      service. 

FUNCTIONING
      OF THE BOARD  

18.     Board
      Meetings 

      Directors
      are expected to attend Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which
      they serve, to spend the time needed, and to meet as frequently as necessary
      to
      properly discharge their responsibilities. Meetings should include presentations
      by management and, when appropriate, outside advisors or consultants, as well
      as
      sufficient time for full and open discussion. Article III of Luby s bylaws
      spells out required procedures for calling and conducting meetings of the Board
      in order to conduct corporate business. The Board sets the number and schedule
      of regular Board meetings for the entire year at the annual meeting of the
      Board
      immediately preceding the annual meeting of the shareholders of the company.
      Currently, the Board has five regular meetings each year. The chairman, the
      chief executive officer, or a majority of directors may call special meetings
      of
      the Board as necessary.  

19.     Board
      Agendas 

      The
      chief
      executive officer in conjunction with the chairman and committee chairs will
      establish and publish an agenda for each meeting of the Board. Board members
      may
      suggest items for inclusion on the agenda and may raise for discussion at any
      Board meeting subjects not on the agenda. 

6 

20.     Board
      Materials Distributed in Advance 

      Management
      is responsible to ensure that the agenda for each meeting is distributed in
      advance of the meeting, together with written materials that are important
      to
      the Board s understanding of the business of the meeting and presentations on
      special subjects. The agenda and accompanying materials should be distributed
      at
      least one week in advance of the meeting to permit directors to prepare for
      the
      meeting. This will conserve Board meeting time and allow discussion to focus
      on
      questions and analysis of these materials. Management will try to keep materials
      as brief as possible while still providing the desired information. Lengthy
      reports or documents, when practical, should be accompanied by executive
      summaries. Directors are encouraged to comment on the adequacy and effectiveness
      of materials provided. Directors are expected to review the agenda and
      accompanying materials before the meeting. 

21.     Attendance
      of Non-Directors at Board Meetings 

      The
      chief
      executive officer may invite members of senior management who are not Board
      members to regularly participate in portions of the Board meeting. Further,
      the
      Board encourages the participation at Board meetings of members of management
      who can provide additional insight into items being discussed or who have
      substantial future potential in the Company and who should be given exposure
      to
      the Board. Portions of all Board meetings will be reserved for private
      deliberation among Board members. 

22.     Separate
       Executive Session  Meetings of Non-management Directors 

      Non-management
      directors will regularly meet in executive sessions, without the presence of
      management directors or executive officers of Luby s (except to the extent the
      non-management directors request the attendance of any executive officers).
      In
      addition, as a matter of practice, non-management directors will meet at the
      conclusion of the regularly scheduled Board meetings whenever requested by
      an
      individual Board member, either in advance of or during Board deliberations.
      They may also meet at other times when the need to do so is established by
      the
      chairman or the presiding independent director, as appropriate, or upon the
      Board s own motion. The chairman or, if the chairman is not independent, the
      presiding independent director, will preside over the executive sessions of
      non-management directors. The chairman/presiding independent director is
      responsible for keeping the chief executive officer informed of any substantive
      deliberations in such executive sessions. These meetings may include a
      discussion with the chief executive officer, to the extent requested by the
      non-management directors. 

23.     Meetings
      of Independent Directors 

      If
      non-management directors include directors who are not independent, then all
      independent directors will meet in executive session at a regularly scheduled
      meeting at least once each year.

FUNCTIONING
      OF COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD  

24.     Board
      Committees 

      The
      Board
      will have at all times a standing Finance and Audit Committee, an Executive
      Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
      The
      current standing committees of the Board are: Executive, Finance and Audit,
      Personnel and Administrative Policy, Executive Compensation, and Nominating
      and
      Corporate Governance. From time to time the Board may create a new or disband
      an
      existing committee depending on particular interests of the Board, issues facing
      Luby s, or legal requirements. 

25.     Committee
      Charters 

      Each
      committee should, with leadership from its chair, maintain a charter describing
      its duties and responsibilities, as well as qualifications for committee
      membership, procedures for committee member appointment and removal, committee
      structure and operations and committee reporting to the Board. Charters
      developed or amended will be reviewed by the Executive Committee and approved
      by
      the full Board. 

26.     Assignment
      and Rotation of Committee Membership 

      The
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in consultation with the chairman
      and the chief executive officer and individual Board members, will assign Board
      members and chairs to various committees, subject to Board approval. Assignments
      must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, any special
      requirements contained in the committee charters, and, insofar as possible,
      with
      the desires of individual members. The Finance and Audit Committee, Executive
      Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall
      be comprised solely of independent directors, taking into account, with respect
      to members of the Finance and Audit Committee, the higher standards of
      independence established in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards for
      members of audit committees. Consideration should be given to rotating committee
      membership and chairs from time to time generally on a three to five year
      schedule. 

27.     Scheduling
      of Committee Meetings and Committee Agendas 

      The
      chair
      of each committee, in collaboration with management and the chairman of the
      Board and with reference to the committee s charter, determine the frequency,
      length, and agenda of each meeting of the committee. 

28.     Committee
      Reports to the Board 

      The
      chair
      of each committee, with the support of management, will report to the full
      Board
      as soon as practical following a committee meeting all significant matters
      discussed and will present recommendations of the committee to the Board for
      action, review, or approval, as appropriate, at each Board meeting. Minutes
      of
      all committee meetings will be distributed to all Board members. 

8 

MISCELLANEOUS  

29.     Board
      Access to Management 

      Board
      members have access to Luby s management, as necessary to fulfill their
      obligations as members of the Board, and will keep the chief executive officer,
      chief operating officer and the chairman informed of any matters of substance
      and concerns that may arise therefrom. Board members should use judgment to
      insure that this contact is not distracting to business operations or that
      it
      could be perceived as infringing on the responsibilities of the chief executive
      officer. Correspondence from a Board member to a member of management should
      be
      copied to the chief executive officer and chairman. 

30.     Board
      Access to Independent Advisors 

      The
      Board
      and its committees have authority to retain independent outside accounting,
      financial, legal, or other advisors at any time, at the expense of Luby s,
      provided that approval of the full Board shall be required for the expenditure
      of $5,000 or more in any twelve-month period for fees paid to such advisors,
      except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in the charter of each
      committee. 

31.     Communications
      with the Public and Various Constituencies 

      The
      chief
      executive officer is responsible for establishing effective communications
      with
      Luby s various constituencies, i.e. press, shareholders, potential investors,
      customers, communities, suppliers, creditors, and corporate partners. Management
      speaks for Luby s, and Board members should initiate communication with these
      constituencies only with the consent and generally at the request of management.
      However, the Board may respond to communications directed to the Board by
      shareholders and members of the public. In accordance with rules of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, Luby s will
      publicly disclose a method by which shareholders and other interested parties
      may communicate directly with the non-employee directors or the Board as a
      whole. 

32.     Assessing
      Board Performance 

      At
      least
      annually the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review with
      all
      Board members their perceptions of the performance and effectiveness of the
      Board and solicit suggestions for improving its performance. The objective
      is to
      increase the effectiveness of the Board and not to evaluate individual Board
      members. The results of this review will be reported to the full Board with
      the
      results and recommended action the committee deems appropriate. 

At
      least
      annually, the Committee will assess the Board s current and projected strengths
      and needs by, among other things, reviewing the Board s current profile, its
      guidelines for membership on the Board of Directors, the Company s current and
      future needs, as well as the Corporate Governance Guidelines.  

9 

Each
      year
      the members of the Board will participate in a review and assessment of the
      Board and of each committee. Such evaluations will be discussed both at the
      Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meetings, as well as at the Board
      of Directors meeting. In connection with such reviews, or at any other time,
      a
      director with concerns regarding performance, attendance, potential conflicts
      of
      interest, or any other concern respecting any other director shall report such
      concerns to the Chairman of the Governance Committee. The Chairman of the
      Governance Committee, in consultation with such other directors as he or she
      deems appropriate will determine how such concerns should be investigated and
      reported to members of the Governance Committee who are not the director in
      question ( Disinterested Committee Members ). If the Disinterested Committee
      Members conclude that the director is not fulfilling his or her duties, they
      will determine what actions should be taken. Such actions may include, without
      limitation, the Chairman of the Board or another Board member discussing the
      situation with the director in question, identifying what steps are required
      to
      improve performance, or, if appropriate, requesting that the director resign
      from the Board. 

33.     Director
      Orientation and Continuing Education 

      Although
      the candidate will receive an informal orientation to the company during the
      selection process, the Chairman of the Board of Directors will arrange for
      formal orientation sessions for newly elected directors. The orientation will
      include briefing by Executive officers, designed to familiarize the new
      directors with the Company s overall business and operations, strategic plans
      and goals, financial statements, and key policies and practices, including
      corporate governance matters.       Each
      new
      director will be given a thorough orientation with respect to his or her duties
      as a director of Luby s, including (a) copies of these Guidelines and other
      corporate governance materials, (b) meetings with the Nominating and Corporate
      Governance Committee, and (c) except to the extent unnecessary for any director
      who is an executive officer of Luby s, background material with respect to
      Luby s, its business and issues of particular significance to Luby s, meetings
      with senior management and visits to Luby s restaurants and facilities. Each new
      director and each new member of any Board Committee also will cooperate in
      fulfilling any additional orientation guidelines that may be recommended
      generally or on an ad hoc basis by the Nominating and Corporate Governance
      Committee or the chair of the committee on which the director serves to help
      assure that such director has the necessary skills to perform his or her
      responsibilities as a director and/or member of any committee. 

Directors
      are expected to regularly attend continuing education seminars concerning
      subject areas that are relevant to Company business and the Board of Directors.
      In addition, the Company will arrange for continuing education topics at Board
      Meetings. 

34.     Board
      Compensation 

      Luby s
      policy is to compensate non-management directors competitively relative to
      companies of comparable size. The Executive Compensation Committee will annually
      recommend to the full Board for its consideration director compensation for
      the
      next year. Director s fees (which include all fees, stock awards, stock options,
      and other consideration given to directors in their capacity as directors)
      are
      the only compensation that Independent directors may receive from
      Luby s.

35.     Stock
      Ownership Guidelines for Directors 

      The
      Board
      believes that each Luby s director should accumulate a meaningful investment in
      Luby s stock and has established guidelines for share ownership. Currently,
      directors are expected to accumulate, over time, common shares with a market
      value of at least $100,000. 

36.     Board
      Attendance at Annual Meetings of Shareholders 

      Directors
      are expected to attend all Luby s Annual Meetings of Shareholders. 

37.     Review
      of
      Guidelines 

      The
      Nominating and Board Governance Committee is responsible for periodic review
      of
      these Guidelines, as well as consideration of other corporate governance issues
      that may, from time to time, merit consideration of the full Board. 

38.     Intent 

      These
      Guidelines are intended to be a statement of general principles to guide the
      Board in formulating corporate policy. The Guidelines are not rules or bylaws.
      They may be amended from time to time by the Board. In addition, the Board
      may
      on occasion depart from the Guidelines when circumstances indicate that a
      departure is in the best interest of Luby s and its shareholders.
