ITEM
      1.      BUSINESS   

General   

The
      Dress
      Barn, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the  Company ,  we,   us,   our 
or other similar terms) operate a chain of women's apparel specialty stores,
      operating principally under the names "   dressbarn   "
      and
    dressbarn       woman    
and,
      since our January 2005 acquisition of Maurices Incorporated,     maurices   . 
Since
      our retail business began in 1962, we have established and marketed our image
      as
      a source of fashion and value for the working woman. We have built our brand
      image as a core resource for a lifestyle-oriented, stylish, value-priced
      assortment of career and casual fashions tailored to our customers  needs. As of
      July 29, 2006, we operated     1,339
      stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia, consisting of 575 Combo stores
      (a combination of    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores),
      173    dressbarn   
      stores,
      45    dressbarn       woman   
      stores
      and     546
         maurices   
      stores.     We
      maintain an Internet web site at      www.dressbarn.com   .
      The
      reference to our Internet web site address in this report does not constitute
      the incorporation by reference of the information contained at this site in
      this
      report. We make available, free of charge through publication on our Internet
      web site, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on
      Form
      10-Q and any current reports on Form 8-K or amendments to those reports filed
      or
      furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as soon as
      reasonably practicable after we have filed with or furnished such materials
      to
      the SEC. 

dressbarn
      and dressbarn woman brands  

Our
         dressbarn   
      stores
      are operated mostly in a combination of    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores,
      or Combo stores, which carry    dressbarn   
      and
      larger-sized    dressbarn       woman   
      merchandise, as well as freestanding    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores.
      These stores offer in-season, moderate to better quality career and casual
      fashion for the working woman at value prices. These brands primarily attract
      female consumers in the mid 30 s to mid 50 s age range. 

maurices
      brand  

The
         maurices   
      stores
      are concentrated in small markets (having populations of approximately 25,000
      to
      100,000) and offer moderately priced, up-to-date fashions designed to appeal
      to
      a younger female consumer than the    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      brands.
   maurices   
      product
      offerings are designed to appeal to the apparel and accessory needs of the
      17 to
      34 year-old-woman, as well as the casual apparel needs of the 17 to 34
      year-old-male. Approximately 90% of    maurices   
      sales
      relate to female-oriented product lines and 10% relate to male-oriented product
      lines.  

Since
      the
      date of the acquisition of Maurices Incorporated, we have been implementing
      the
      most effective ways to combine and coordinate our brands so as to optimize
      performance and efficiencies. The integration process with    maurices   
      has been
      substantially completed. Substantially all of    maurices    
      management team prior to the acquisition continues to manage the daily
      operations of    maurices   .

Company
      Strengths and Strategies    

Our
         dressbarn   
      stores
      differentiate themselves from (i) off-price retailers by our carefully edited
      selection of proprietary, in-season, first-quality merchandise, service-oriented
      salespeople and our comfortable shopping environment, (ii) department stores
      by
      our value pricing, customer service and convenient locations and (iii) other
      specialty apparel retailers by our unique, lifestyle-oriented merchandise and
      our continuous focus on connecting with    dressbarn   's
      target
      customer. As part of this focus, we have successfully developed our own brand,
      which constituted the vast majority of our net sales for the fiscal year ended
      July 29, 2006. 

The
         dressbarn   
      brand
      and the    dressbarn
      woman   
      brand
      strive to be the preferred career and casual women s specialty store for the
      moderate 30 to 55 year-old-woman, (sizes 4 to 24), providing differentiated,
      current fashion merchandise at value prices in a comfortable, easy-to-shop
      environment. We cater to time-pressured working women who want their shopping
      trips to be efficient by offering one-stop shopping from career to casual
      sportswear, as well as dresses, suits, special occasion clothing, accessories,
      jewelry and shoes. We seek to maintain a distinct fashion point of view, editing
      our assortments frequently in accordance with our targeted customer's taste
      and
      style. Merchandise is arranged conveniently by lifestyle and category. We
      believe our customers have a high degree of confidence that they will quickly
      find the styles that match their preferences and are responding positively
      to
      our updated fashion direction. This, along with attentive service, helps to
      create a loyal, repeat customer. To accommodate this customer, we locate our
      stores primarily in convenient strip centers and operate most of them seven
      days
      and six nights a week.  

To
      achieve growth in same store sales, our strategy is to increase customer traffic
      to our store locations by (a) developing and distributing more unique,
      fashion-forward quality merchandise not found at our competitors while
      maintaining value prices, (b) investing in technology and training to enhance
      the customer service levels in our stores and the product knowledge of our
      sales
      associates and (c) spending on marketing, advertising and public relations
      focused on upgrading the image and communicating the personality and voice
      of
      the    dressbarn   
      brand,
      as well as on special promotions, outreach programs and rewards to current
      and
      potential customers, many of whom are    dressbarn

      card with no credit risk to us. 

dressbarn   
      is one
      of the largest national specialty store chains in its segment offering current
      career and casual fashions at value prices.    dressbarn   
      attributes its success to its: (i) national brand recognition and loyal customer
      base; (ii) long-standing relationships with vendors and manufacturers of quality
      merchandise, both domestic and overseas; (iii) strong, consistent customer
      focus; (iv) low cost operating structure; and (v) experienced merchandise and
      marketing management team. We have   developed
      long-standing relationships with our existing customers, enjoying strong
      customer loyalty.  

Over
      the
      past several years, we have gradually repositioned ourselves to appeal to a
      more
      fashion-conscious customer while maintaining our focus on our target customer
      who has also responded positively to our current fashion lifestyle direction.
      This repositioning includes: enhancing the existing    dressbarn   
      image;
      defining a feminine personality and voice for the brand; building brand
      awareness through various marketing, advertising and public relations campaigns
      and vehicles; adopting a new logo; and developing cause-related programs within
      our communities, all geared towards resonating with existing and potential
      customers and associates.   To
      enhance the development of the    dressbarn   
      brand,
      we changed and updated our in-store graphics, and developed a prototype store
      design.   We
      have
      expanded the use of our    dressbarn   
      label to
      virtually all our merchandise offerings, emphasizing quality, value and fashion.

To
      strengthen our    dressbarn   
      brand
      image and marketing effectiveness, we have evolved from reliance on weekly
      newspaper advertising to targeted national magazine advertising and expanded
      direct mail. We advertise in approximately 12 national lifestyle magazines
      with
      ads designed to enhance brand awareness and to bring new customers into our
      stores. We also work with a public relations firm to increase editorial coverage
      regarding our fashion and participate in charitable initiatives within our
      communities, particularly with the American Cancer Society, Dress For Success
      and the American Heart Association. 

Our
      merchandise offerings reflect a focused and balanced assortment of career and
      casual fashions tailored to our customers  demands. We believe we offer
      customers unique merchandise that is fashion current, with seasonal updated
      looks and colors arriving daily. The merchandise mix has evolved to a more
      updated contemporary style, shifting in focus from structured, career looks
      to
      softer, more casual outfits and assortments. We have upgraded our fabrications,
      offering value, style and fashion while maintaining quality and price points.
      We
      attempt to offer merchandise with sizes that are true, and have consistent
      fits,
      and that have easy to care for fabrics and quality construction.  

Our
      stores continue to reflect newness and fashion, with key items accented by
      six
      floorset changes a year. Stores receive shipments daily for a constant flow
      of
      new looks to keep the assortments fresh and exciting. L  ifestyle
      merchandising is key; emphasizing mix and match outfit dressing within strong
      color stories.  
      Our
      prototype store design features an easier to shop layout, warmer colors and
      new
      wood fixtures for enhanced merchandise presentation. During the fifty-two weeks
      ended July 29, 2006 ( Fiscal 2006 ),    dressbarn   
      utilized
      this design in its newly opened stores and updated approximately 55 stores
      to
      this design;    dressbarn   
      plans to
      update approximately 60 of its store locations during its fiscal year ending
      July 28, 2007 ( Fiscal 2007 ). As of July 29, 2006, nearly seventy five percent
      of the    dressbarn   
      stores
      feature this design.

dressbarn   
      continues to invest in technology to improve merchandising and sales, reduce
      costs and enhance productivity. We utilize a field information system for all
      our Regional and District Sales Managers via laptop computers, providing sales,
      inventories and other operational data. We   upgraded
      our back-office store system software to include such features as inventory
      scanning, quick credit approval for new applications, automated new hire entry
      and store email. We utilize a DVDi Learning Management System ( LMS ), which
      enables sales associates to view training DVDs. These training DVDs assist
      our
      sales associates with the skills they need to properly serve our customers.
      Also
      our POS system has the ability to capture debit card transactions, centralize
      credit authorizations, improve promotion transactions handling, and allow swift
      customer transactions. Our  
      distribution center systems continue to be refined to reduce per-unit
      distribution costs. 

All
      aspects of    dressbarn   's
      stores
      are designed to be responsive to the    dressbarn   
      customer. In past customer surveys, sales associates were viewed as superior
      to
      our competition and were a competitive advantage. Since 1962, we have been
      consistent in targeting price-conscious and fashion-minded working women. The
      convenient locations of our stores primarily in strip and outlet centers,
      carefully edited coordinated merchandise arranged for ease of shopping,
      comfortable store environment and friendly sales associates embody    dressbarn   's
      strong
      focus on our customers.    dressbarn   's
      training program encourages our sales associates to assist customers in a
      low-key and friendly manner. We have various programs to recognize and reward
      our best sales associates. We believe this enhances our customers' shopping
      experience by avoiding aggressive sales tactics that would result from a
      commission-based compensation structure.  

In
      January 2003, through a wholly owned subsidiary, we purchased for approximately
      $45.3 million a distribution/office facility and 16 acres of adjacent land
      in
      Suffern, New York (the  Suffern Facility ), of which the major portion is our
      corporate offices and    dressbarn   
      distribution center. The acquisition of the Suffern Facility provides
      flexibility for future expansion.  

Based
      on
      the economic success of our larger size Combo stores, almost all of Fiscal
      2007
      store openings will be Combo stores between 7,000 and 8,000 square feet. Combo
      stores provide us with greater presence in shopping centers, give us more
      leverage in negotiating lease terms, enable us to achieve lower operating cost
      ratios and offer increased flexibility in merchandise presentation. We have
      in
      the past also purchased leased locations from other retailers, some of which
      were too small for a Combo store and were opened as individual locations.
      Of the 39    dressbarn   
      stores
      we opened during Fiscal 2006, 35 were Combo store locations and four were
      individual locations. Three stores were converted to Combo stores during Fiscal
      2006. We expect to continue to open stores primarily in strip centers, as well
      as outlet locations. In Fiscal 2007, we plan to open approximately 105 new
      stores, consisting of 65    maurices   
      locations and 40    dressbarn   
      locations.  

In
      conjunction with our strategy of adding mostly Combo stores, we continue to
      close or relocate our underperforming locations and closed 25 locations during
      Fiscal 2006, compared to 36 closed in the fifty-two weeks ended July 30, 2005
      ( Fiscal 2005 ). We estimate that we may close approximately 25 more locations
      in Fiscal 2007. We have the option under a substantial number of our store
      leases to terminate the lease at little or no cost if specified sales volumes
      are not achieved, typically only in the first few years of the lease, affording
      us greater flexibility to close certain underperforming stores. Our continued
      opening of new stores, net of store closings, resulted in an aggregate
   dressbarn   
      store
      square footage increase of approximately 1.8% in Fiscal 2006, after a 1.0%
      increase in Fiscal 2005. Net of store closings, we currently plan to increase
      our aggregate    dressbarn   
      store
      square footage by approximately 1.7% in Fiscal 2007.  

Our
      marketing programs focus on   developing
      stronger relationships with existing customers, increasing loyalty by making
      them feel better about    dressbarn   .
      Concurrently, the programs try to create awareness among those who are not
      already customers and inspire them to visit our stores and see what    dressbarn   
      has to
      offer. One major source of marketing information is the    dressbarn   
      credit
      card. With almost 3 million cardholders, we continue to segment our best
      customers and target them with exclusive offers and recognition. We have created
      a customer database for our c  ustomer
      relationship management ( CRM ) system. The CRM database tracks customer
      transactions, with the ability to target customers with specific offers and
      promotions, including coupons, pre-sale announcements, and special events.
      The
      CRM database is used for our direct mail program, providing more productive
      direct mail lists as well as targeting potential customers within each store s
      trading area and for new stores.  

maurices    
      strategy
      is a unique combination of small market expertise, target customer intimacy
      and
      maximization of efficiencies, creating a profitable brand that delivers the
      fashion, value and service needs of the 17 to 34 year-old-female and male
      consumers. 

We
      believe that    maurices    
      competitive advantage is achieved through its product offering and its
      locations. The wide selection of style, color and current fashion is in stark
      contrast to the large discount and department stores found in small markets.
      These retailers generally offer great depth of fashion basics.    maurices   
      benefits
      from strategically locating close to these competitors, capitalizing on the
      traffic they generate.  

5 

A
      further
      differentiator for the    maurices   
      brand is
      the shopping experience. Integral to this is the relationship our associates
      build with their customers. These relationships build brand awareness as well
      as
      position us as the fashion leader in our communities. In addition, visual
      merchandising simplifies the shopping experience by highlighting outfits,
      utilizing mannequins as silent sales people. We believe these standards tend
      to
      influence the consumers  shopping behavior. Recent surveys show that a majority
      of the time, our customers  purchases can be tied to the fashions displayed in
      our stores. The outcome is a visually stimulating environment with a relaxed
      and
      helpful staff. 

maurices    
female
      fashion assortment is positioned to appeal to the apparel and accessory needs
      of
      the 17 to 34 year-old-woman. This product offering is specifically tailored
      to
      the fashion needs of those with a 20-something attitude, while appealing to
      the
      broader 17 to 34 year-old-demographic.    maurices    
male
      fashion assortment targets the casual needs of the 21 year-old-man while
      appealing to the broader 17 to 34 year-old-male age range.    maurices   
      has
      targeted a relatively broad age bracket due to the characteristics found within
      the small town retail apparel environment.  

To
      provide customers with a variety of styles and colors,    maurices    
women s
      apparel assortment is divided into three lifestyles, casual, career and dressy,
      each with distinct collections. Based on market research, different colors
      are
      developed for each lifestyle for each of the five major seasonal floorsets
      of
      the year.    maurices   
      focuses
      on five major seasonal floorsets due to the variation in customer demand over
      the course of the year. By adjusting the lifestyle mix,    maurices   
      is able
      to focus on the target customers  varying seasonal apparel and accessory
      needs. 

maurices 
         merchandise
      is sold under three brand names.        The
      original    maurices   
      brand
      encompasses women s casual clothing, career wear and accessories.    Studio
      Y   
      represents women s dressy apparel and is fashionable and trendy with a younger
      target audience.    Industrial
      Exchange   
      encompasses core, casual and fashion clothing for men.    maurices    
brands
      have been developed to tailor its image to specific customer segments and
      groups. Each brand represents a different aspect of    maurices    
broad
      product offering. We believe that    maurices    
brands
      increase store loyalty by giving the customer another image to connect or
      identify with, and that our brands have a strong following.  

maurices   
      continues to invest in systems to support merchandising and sales, reduce costs
      and enhance productivity. In 2006,    maurices   
      implemented  MID , a new improved merchandise allocation system. We made
      physical and system changes in the distribution center to improve functionality
      and increase the rate of product movement. We implemented changes to accept
      debit cards in our stores. We moved all our customer information to the NSB
      CRM
      system located at    dressbarn   
      to take
      advantage of their expertise. We gained additional synergies by moving our
      import process to the    dressbarn   
      system
      as well as taking advantage of leveraging our purchases. In addition, we utilize
      a field information system for all our Regional and District Sales Managers
      via
      laptop computers, providing sales, inventories and other operational data.
      We
  upgraded
      our store system software to include such features as markdown scanning for
      price changes, quick credit approval for new applications, automated new hire
      entry and store email. The    maurices   
      point-of-sale ( POS ) system has a real-time intranet network to each store.
      This allows us to add functionality to our POS system and the ability to capture
      debit card transactions, centralize credit authorizations, improve promotion
      transactions handling, and speed up customer transaction time. Our  
      distribution center systems utilize RF technology to run virtually paperless.
      We
      have extensive data warehouses associated with our merchandise, sales and
      financial systems that allow for extensive analytical reporting. 

maurices   
      will
      continue to capitalize on our recent expansion success, with plans to open
      65
      new stores in Fiscal 2007. The expansion strategy continues to be on the small
      and metro fringe markets. We plan to focus on strip centers and small malls,
      with a continuing test of outlet stores in Fiscal 2007.    maurices   
      expects
      to close approximately seven locations in Fiscal 2007. The typical    maurices   
      store is
      between 3,500 and 6,000 square feet. Net of store closings, we currently plan
      to
      increase our    maurices   
      square
      footage by roughly nine percent in Fiscal 2007, in addition to the nine percent
      gain in 2006. The small town specialty retail store concept is unique in its
      positioning, with the lower occupancy and operating cost structure resulting
      in
      higher levels of profitability. 

We
      have
      well-established relationships with our domestic and offshore vendors and
      manufacturers, including our buying agents, often being one of their largest
      accounts. These relationships, together with our buying power and strong credit
      profile, enable us to receive favorable purchasing terms, exclusive merchandise
      and expedited delivery times. 

dressbarn   
      and
   maurices   
      utilize
      their web sites (    www.dressbarn.com   
      and
   www.maurices.com   
      ) to
      reinforce store promotions, provide store and product information, help to
      drive
      store traffic and communicate with their retail customers. In addition, we
      sell
      gift cards on our websites.  

We
      continually seek to reduce costs in all aspects of our operations and to create
      cost-consciousness at all levels. We believe that our internally generated
      funds
      will provide us with the opportunity to pursue our long-term strategies
      regarding new stores, capital expenditures and marketing and brand development.

6 

Merchandising

Virtually
      all merchandising decisions affecting our stores are made centrally. Day-to-day
         dressbarn   
      store
      merchandising is under the direction of a Chief Merchandising Officer, and
      five
      additional merchandise managers. We utilize a Visual Merchandising Department
      to
      communicate various floorsets and presentations to the stores. We generally
      have
      six complete floorset changes per year to keep our merchandise presentation
      fresh and exciting. There is a constant flow of new merchandise to the stores
      to
      maintain newness. Store prices and markdowns are determined centrally but may
      be
      adjusted locally in response to competitive situations. Generally, the majority
      of the merchandise sold by us is uniformly carried by all stores, with a
      percentage varied by management according to regional or consumer tastes or
      the
      volume of a particular store. To keep merchandise seasonal and in current
      fashion, inventory is reviewed weekly and markdowns are taken as appropriate
      to
      expedite selling. We offer first-quality, in-season merchandise, with
      approximately 60% of our sales volume derived from sportswear, including
      sweaters, knit and woven tops, pants and skirts. The remainder of our sales
      volume includes dresses, suits, blazers, outerwear and accessories.    dressbarn       woman   
      merchandise features larger sizes of styles similar to    dressbarn   
      merchandise. Our Petite departments feature merchandise similar to    dressbarn   
      merchandise in petite sizes. In addition to our broad assortment of career
      and
      casual wear, we offer other items in selected stores including hosiery, handbags
      and shoes. There are separate merchandising teams for    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   . 

Our
      direct sourcing of merchandise improves our control over the flow of merchandise
      into our stores and enables us to better specify quantities, styles, colors,
      size breaks and delivery dates. In addition, we believe our direct sourcing
      provides us with more flexibility by allowing for higher initial mark-ons.
      We
      believe we have the expertise to execute our brand strategy due to our extensive
      experience sourcing goods, our position as a merchandiser of established
      fashions, and our prior experience with private brands. Nearly all of our sales
      are generated under our    dressbarn   
      labels.

dressbarn   
      continues to expand the number of shoe and petite-size departments within our
      stores. As of July 29, 2006, 391 stores had shoe departments and 248 stores
      featured petite-sized departments. 

Merchandising
      for    maurices   
      is under
      the direction of a Chief Merchandising Officer, and three divisional merchandise
      managers.    maurices    
      objective is to be a moderately priced, specialty fashion retailer offering
      value and service to its target customers. For Fiscal 2006,    maurices 
         sales
      of
      women s apparel accounted for approximately 77% of    maurices    
net
      sales, while women s accessories accounted for 15%, men s apparel accounted for
      7%, and men s accessories accounted for 1%.      maurices   
      offers
      first-quality, in-season merchandise, with a large portion of sales volume
      derived from sportswear, including sweaters, knit and woven tops, denim and
      casual pants.  

The
         maurices
         product
      strategy has been developed to maximize sales and profitability in small
      markets, a market place often requiring unique considerations. This strategy
      emphasizes the importance of product variety. This style selection and variety
      supports the desire of young adults to express their individuality. We believe
      that particularly in small markets the fashion conscious consumer does not
      want
      to wear the same outfits as their peers. This variety is also a key
      differentiator from the big box retailers in the market that offer narrow and
      deep assortments of key items. The wide range in    maurices   
      product
      offering reduces its dependence on a limited number of products, helping to
      avoid the volatility of a narrow merchandising strategy. 

maurices    
      product
      strategy is supported by our pricing philosophy. This approach emphasizes value
      by positioning our fashion assortment at prices lower than large market
      specialty competitors. This combination of fashion and value results in
   maurices   
      generating in excess of 65% of sales volume at regular price, with the remainder
      sold through planned promotions or discounts made in order to maintain inventory
      freshness. 

maurices   
      utilizes
      micro-merchandising to maximize niche sales opportunities at the store level.
      By
      micro-merchandising    maurices   
      is able
      to ensure that the store s product mix accurately represents the local market s
      preferences.    maurices   
      augments
      each store s core assortment by 15% to 20% to successfully address individual
      store demands and customer preferences. Two examples of    maurices    
      micro-merchandising strategy are size allocations by store and the timing of
      seasonal clothing deliveries by climate zone. In order to satisfy the size
      needs
      of its markets and the targeted age group,    maurices   
      micro-merchandises by location demand and offers extended size ranges.
      Additionally,    maurices   
      allocates product to stores based on local sales patterns. All of these
      micro-merchandising initiatives allow    maurices   
      to
      maximize its sales relevance within its target markets. 

Buying
      and Distribution   

Buying
      is
      conducted on a departmental basis for    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   .
         dressbarn   
      has over
      40 buyers and assistant buyers supervised by the General Merchandising Manager
      and five merchandise managers. We also use independent buying representatives
      in
      New York and overseas. We obtain our merchandise from approximately 200 vendors,
      and no vendor accounted for over 5% of    dressbarn   
      purchases. In Fiscal 2006, imports accounted for over 50% of merchandise
      purchases and no vendor accounted for over 5% of    dressbarn   
      import
      purchases. Typical lead times for making purchases from vendors range from
      approximately one month for items purchased domestically to up to six months
      for
      merchandise purchased overseas.  

7 

All
      merchandise for our    dressbarn   
      stores
      is received from vendors at our central warehouse and distribution facility
      in
      Suffern, New York, where it is inspected, allocated and shipped to our stores.
      Our distribution operations occupy approximately 410,000 square feet of the
      Suffern facility. We use our strong relationships with vendors to lower
      operating costs by shifting freight and insurance costs to the vendors and
      we
      typically require them to provide ancillary services. For example, nearly 100%
      of our merchandise is pre-ticketed by vendors and approximately 60% of the
      hanging garments purchased by us are delivered on floor-ready hangers. In
      addition, 45% of our merchandise receipts are pre-packaged for distribution
      to
      stores, which allows for efficiencies in our distribution center by using
      cross-docking. 

We
      generally do not warehouse store merchandise, but distribute it promptly to
      stores. There are instances where we do hold basic merchandise for future
      distribution. Turnaround time between the receipt of merchandise from the vendor
      and shipment to the stores is usually three days or less, and shipments are
      made
      daily to most stores, maintaining the freshness of merchandise. Because of
      such
      frequent shipments, the stores do not require significant storage space.

maurices   
      has
      approximately 60 buyers, assistant buyers, and planning and allocation
      associates supervised by three Divisional Merchandise Managers and four Planning
      and Allocation Managers who report to the Chief Merchandising Officer.
   maurices    
vendor
      relationship philosophy is to create strategic business partners.    maurices    
goal
      has been to have the top five suppliers per apparel segment make up 75% of
         maurices    
      purchases. Ideally, these top five suppliers should fluctuate minimally. The
      balance between the top five and new suppliers allows for consistency and
      strategic alignment along with exploration and testing of new vendors. However,
         maurices   
      is under
      no ongoing obligation to purchase from any individual supplier, thereby
      permitting    maurices   
      to make
      supplier decisions based on the quality of product, style selection and price
      competitiveness. In addition,    maurices    
direct
      import program accounts for approximately 15% of its total
      purchases.  
      No
   maurices   
      vendor
      accounted for over 5% of   total
      company   purchases
      in Fiscal 2006 or Fiscal 2005. 

We
      supply
      all of the    maurices   
      stores
      through a modern 360,000-square-foot distribution center in Des Moines, Iowa.
      The productivity of the distribution center is enhanced by working closely
      with
   maurices    
      merchants and vendors. Approximately 97% of    maurices    
      merchandise is pre-ticketed and floor ready while approximately 25%
      of the merchandise is packed in cartons that can flow directly from the
      receiving dock to the shipping dock with no need for repacking.  In
      addition to processing merchandise, the distribution center is the site for
      a
      number of other functions.  All store supplies are warehoused in,
      processed by and shipped from the distribution center, combining store supply
      shipments with merchandise freight to lower overall transportation costs. New
         maurices   
      store
      openings are staged in the distribution center for fixtures, supplies and
      merchandise. 

Store
      Locations and Properties   

As
      of
      July 29, 2006, we operated 1,339 stores in     48
      states
      and the District of Columbia. 758 of the stores were conveniently located in
      strip centers and 229 stores were located in outlet centers. During Fiscal
      2006,
      no store accounted for as much as 1% of our total sales. The table below
      indicates the type of shopping facility in which the stores were
      located: 

As
      of
      July 29, 2006,    dressbarn   
      had 5.9
      million total square feet in all its stores and    maurices   
      had 2.7
      million total square feet.

Operations
      and Management   

In
      considering new store locations,    dressbarn   
      focuses
      on expanding in existing major trading and high-density markets, adding to
      a
      cluster of suburban or other locations. With respect to suburban and other
      locations, we consider the concentration of our target customer base, the
      average household income in the surrounding area and the location of the
      proposed store relative to competitors and anchor tenants in the shopping
      center. We also seek to expand into new markets. Within the specific strip
      or
      outlet center, we evaluate the proposed co-tenants, local population
      demographics, the traffic count of the existing center and the location of
      the
      store within the center. Our real estate committee, which includes members
      of
      senior management, must approve all new leases. The committee also receives
      input from field management.  

maurices   
      stores
      are primarily concentrated in small and metro fringe markets in the United
      States. Small markets are defined as areas with populations of 25,000 to 100,000
      people, where    maurices   
      stores
      are usually located in strip centers or small malls. Metro fringe markets border
      metropolitan areas, where    maurices   
      stores
      are most often located in strip centers anchored by Target, Kohl s or similar
      stores.  

Our
         dressbarn   
      and
   maurices   
      stores
      are designed to create a comfortable and pleasant shopping environment for
      customers. Merchandise and displays at all stores are set up according to
      uniform guidelines and plans distributed by merchandising management. Our
      merchandise is carefully arranged by lifestyle category (e.g., career, casual
      and weekend wear) for ease of shopping. The stores also have private fitting
      rooms, drive aisles, appealing lighting, carpeting, background music and
      centralized cashier desks. Strategically located throughout the stores are
      "lifestyle" posters showing the customer models wearing outfits coordinated
      from
      among the stores' fashion offerings. Our interior graphics and racktop signs
      are
      designed to provide for a more open and easy to shop environment.  

All
         dressbarn   
      and
   maurices   
      stores
      are directly managed and operated by us. The store manager typically staffs
      each
      store with at least one sales associate during non-peak hours, with additional
      sales associates added as needed at peak hours. The sales associates perform
      all
      store operations, from receiving and processing merchandise and arranging it
      for
      display, to assisting customers. Each store manager reports to a District Sales
      Manager who, in turn, reports to a Regional Sales Manager. We employ 10 Regional
      Sales Managers for    dressbarn   
      and 3
      Regional Sales Managers for    maurices   .
         dressbarn   
      has
      approximately 100 District Sales Managers and    maurices   
      has
      approximately 30 District Sales Managers. District Sales Managers visit each
      store on a regular basis to review merchandise levels and presentation, staff
      training and personnel performance, expense control, security, cleanliness
      and
      adherence to our operating procedures.  

We
      motivate our    dressbarn   
      sales
      associates through promotion from within, creative incentive programs,
      competitive wages and the opportunity for bonuses. Sales associates compete
      in a
      broad variety of company-wide contests involving sales goals and other measures
      of performance. The contests are designed to boost store profitability, create
      a
      friendly competitive atmosphere among associates and offer opportunities for
      additional compensation. Management believes that our creative incentive
      programs provide an important tool for building cohesive and motivated sales
      teams at each store. We utilize comprehensive training programs at the store
      level in order to ensure that the customer will receive friendly and helpful
      service. They include (i) our DVDi LMS training system, (ii) ongoing DVDi
      training and (iii) one-on-one training of sales associates by store managers
      and
      district sales managers. At    maurices   ,
      the
      training includes (i) management training programs (ii) interactive DVD training
      and (iii) one-on-one training of sales associates by store managers and district
      sales managers. 

Almost
      75% of    dressbarn    s
      sales
      in Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005 and 70% in Fiscal 2004 were paid for by credit
      card or debit card, with the remainder being paid by cash or check.
      Approximately 68% of    maurices    
sales
      in Fiscal 2006 and 64% in Fiscal 2005 were paid for by credit cards, with the
      remainder being paid by cash or check. Consistent with the other credit cards
      it
      accepts, we assume no credit risk with respect to either the    dressbarn   
      credit
      card or the    maurices   
      credit
      card, but pay a percentage of sales as a service charge to the third party
      financial institution. As of July 29, 2006, the number of cardholders of the
         dressbarn   
      credit
      card was approximately 3.0 million and the number of cardholders of the
   maurices   
      credit
      card was 1.7 million. The average dollar value per transaction on the
   dressbarn   
      credit
      card and the    maurices   
      credit
      card during Fiscal 2006 was approximately 75% and 64%, respectively, greater
      than the average dollar value of all other transactions. The    dressbarn   
      credit
      card and the    maurices   
      credit
      card represented approximately 23% and 28%, respectively, of each division s
      sales in Fiscal 2006.  

Virtually
      all of our stores are open seven days a week. Stores located in strip, malls
      and
      outlet centers conform to the hours of other stores in the center and are open
      most evenings.  

Advertising
      and Marketing   

As
      the
      lifestyles and behavior of our customers changed, and as the transformation
      of
   dressbarn
         accelerated,
      our method and style of communication also changed. Abandoning newspaper
      advertising, we determined direct mail was a more targeted and cost effective
      way to communicate our fashion and promotional message. We believe in and
      utilize a customer relationship management ( CRM ) system to track customer
      transactions. This serves as a critical tool directing strategic decisions
      for
      our direct mail initiatives. We focus on targeted marketing through direct
      mail
      that has been our most effective means to reach customers, build relationships
      and drive customers into our stores thereby increasing traffic and
      sales. 

10 

Our
      national print advertising campaign in lifestyle magazines communicates our
      new
      feminine personality and voice and features our current updated fashions at
      affordable prices, enhancing the perceived value of the brand. These national
      ads are designed to upgrade our image, create awareness of the brand and
      increase brand loyalty, thus increasing share of mind and wallet of our
      customers. 

National
      cause related marketing initiatives that resonate with our customers and are
      conducted at the local level are significant contributors to creating brand
      affinity. Our key partners are The American Cancer Society, Dress For Success,
      American Heart Association and World Vision. Through these programs,
   dressbarn
         reinforces
      that it is an important and integral member of our communities. 

maurices   
      focuses
      its marketing initiatives on communicating the fashion and lifestyle attitudes
      of its target customers through compelling window and in-store collateral;
      strong, dimensional visual merchandising execution; and the use of branded
      promotional direct mail vehicles. Supported by its partnership with a public
      relations firm,    maurices   
      has been
      able to garner editorial exposure highlighting both its fashion, offering high
      perceived value, and its cause related efforts.    

Critical
      to the brand's strategy to building customer affinity is the focus on its two
      loyalty programs, Take Ten and Get Connected, as well as incentives specifically
      designed to attract the    maurices   
      credit
      card customers. Additionally, both national cause-related marketing initiatives,
      such as Relay For Life and Hometown Pride programs, are conducted at the local
      level, reinforcing    maurices   
      as an
      integral member of its communities. 

Management
      Information Systems   

We
      are
      implementing the Oracle Retail Merchandising System for the    dressbarn   
      segment.
   maurices   
      currently utilizes the Oracle Retail Merchandising System. Implementation of
      the
      system is expected to be completed by July 2007. We have engaged several
      third-party consulting firms to assist with the implementation. We have also
      dedicated several internal personnel on a part-time and a full-time basis to
      work on the implementation. As part of the implementation, we are also
      reengineering certain business processes and/or merchandise reports to minimize
      the number of modifications to the system necessary to customize the standard
      functionality of the Oracle Retail Merchandising system and to conform it to
      the
      current state of our existing legacy merchandise system. Several manual
      processes will be automated with the implementation. The system will expand
      the
      capability of    dressbarn   
      to
      identify and analyze sales trends and consumer data, and achieve planning and
      inventory management improvements.  

dressbarn   
      has a
      management information system which integrates all major aspects of our
      business, including sales, distribution, purchasing, inventory control,
      merchandise planning and replenishment, and financial systems. All    dressbarn   
      stores
      utilize a POS system with price look-up capabilities for both inventory and
      sales transactions. In addition, the rollout of a new POS system with many
      enhanced features to all our stores was completed in the first quarter of Fiscal
      2005. We installed a new wide area network in Fiscal 2004. This system allows
      us
      to add functionality to our POS system with the ability to capture debit card
      transactions, centralize credit authorizations, improve promotion transactions
      handling, and speed up customer transaction time. In addition, we began to
      sell
      gift cards and use merchandise credit cards in the first quarter of Fiscal
      2005.

Our
      current merchandising system tracks merchandise from the inception of the
      purchase order, through receipt at the distribution center, through the
      distribution planning process, and ultimately to the point of sale. To monitor
      the performance of various styles, management reviews sales and inventory
      levels, organized by department, class, vendor, style, color and store. The
      current system enables us to identify slow-moving merchandise to mark down
      or
      efficiently transfer to stores selling such items more rapidly. We analyze
      historic projected sales trends to efficiently schedule store personnel,
      minimizing labor costs while allowing for a high level of sales. We believe
      that
      investments in technology enhance operating efficiencies and position
   dressbarn   
      for
      future growth. We utilize a DVDi Learning Management System (LMS), where sales
      associates are able to take tests for consistency across all of our stores.
      The
      LMS system is part of the back-office store system which also includes automated
      time and attendance, quicker processing of credit card applications and
      integrated email and messaging. 

Each
         maurices   
      store is
      connected with the corporate office through its point of sale terminal. The
      store s point of sale terminal utilizes CRS software that provides bar-coded
      ticket scanning, automatic price look-up on both regular and promotional prices,
      electronic check and credit authorization, and automatic nightly data
      transmission between the store and    maurices    
      corporate offices. In addition, the CRS software supports a company Intranet
      used to communicate between the corporate office and all store locations. Data
      from each store is processed nightly through the loss prevention and sales
      audit
      systems at the corporate office. These systems are capable of monitoring trends
      at the individual store level to detect signs of inadequate training or fraud.
      We believe that    maurices    
      infrastructure, including its headquarters, distribution center, warehousing
      and
      information technology systems, is capable of supporting substantial growth
      with
      limited incremental investment. 

11 

Trademarks   

We
      have
      previously been issued U.S. Certificates of Registration of Trademark or have
      trademark applications pending for the operating names of our stores and our
      major private label merchandise (   dressbarn   ,
         maurices   ,
      Studio
      Y   and
      Industrial Exchange  ,
      among
      others)  .
        We
        believe
      our    dressbarn   ,
         dressbarn       woman   ,
         maurices   
      and
      Studio Y  
      trademarks are materially important to our business. We also believe that our
      rights to these properties are adequately protected.  

Employees   

As
      of
      July 29, 2006, we had approximately 12,800 employees of whom approximately
      7,800
      worked part-time. A number of temporary employees are usually added during
      the
      peak selling periods. None of our employees are covered by any collective
      bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be
      good. 

Seasonality   

Our
      sales
      are evenly split between our Fall (August to January) and Spring (February
      to
      July) seasons. Though we do not consider our business seasonal, we have
      historically experienced substantially lower earnings in our second fiscal
      quarter ending in January than during our other three fiscal quarters,
      reflecting the intense promotional atmosphere that has characterized the holiday
      shopping season in recent years.    maurices   
      has
      historically experienced losses and lower revenues in January, reflecting the
      decrease in demand following the holiday shopping season. In addition, our
      quarterly results of operations may fluctuate materially depending on, among
      other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather
      conditions, shifts in timing of certain holidays, the number and timing of
      new
      store openings and closings, net sales contributed by new stores, and changes
      in
      our merchandise mix. 

Competition   

The
      retail apparel industry is highly competitive with numerous competitors,
      including department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores, discount
      stores, mass merchandisers and Internet-based retailers, many of which have
      substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. Many
      department stores offer a broader selection of merchandise than we offer. In
      addition, many department stores continue to be promotional and reduce their
      selling prices, and in some cases are expanding into markets in which we have
      a
      significant market presence. Some of our in-market competitors include JCPenney,
      Kohl s and Sears. Our business is vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to
      less than optimal selection as a result of these factors. If we fail to compete
      successfully, we could face lower net sales and may decide to offer greater
      discounts to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability.
      We
      believe that we have established and reinforced our image as a source of fashion
      and value by focusing on our target customer, the fashion-minded working woman,
      and that we are competitive with respect to our national brand recognition
      and
      loyal customer base. 

maurices    
stores
      are typically located in the retail hub of a market, anchored by a large
      retailer or discounter such as JCPenney or Wal-Mart. We believe that
   maurices   
      differentiates itself from its competitors based on having a wider variety
      of
      lifestyle fashions catering to a younger demographic group and by offering
      superior customer service. Based on customer surveys,    maurices   
      believes
      that its customers consider JCPenney as a choice when shopping for basics or
      career needs and Wal-Mart for their essentials. Based on customer surveys,
         maurices   
      believes
      its customers do not consider Cato or Fashion Bug for their fashion needs as
      their products cater to customers of a different size and with different fashion
      preferences and economic situation.    maurices    
primary
      out-of-market competitors include American Eagle, Aeropostale, Old Navy, Target
      and Kohl s.    maurices   
      differentiates itself from these competitors on the basis of one or more of
      the
      following factors, lower prices, having a more varied selection in small markets
      and by offering superior service.

ITEM
      1A.      RISK
      FACTORS   

Our
      business is dependent upon our ability to predict accurately fashion trends,
      customer preferences and other fashion-related
      factors.   

Customer
      tastes and fashion trends are volatile and tend to change rapidly, particularly
      for women s apparel. Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate
      and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a timely
      manner. Accordingly, any failure by us to anticipate, identify and respond
      to
      changing fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the
      merchandise in our stores, which in turn could adversely affect our business
      and
      our image with our customers. If we miscalculate either the market for our
      merchandise or our customers  tastes or purchasing habits, we may be required to
      sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below average markups over
      cost, or below cost, which would have an adverse effect on our margins and
      results of operations. 

We
      face challenges to grow our business and to manage our
      growth.   

Our
      growth is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to successfully add new
      stores and close underperforming locations. In addition, on a routine basis,
      we
      close underperforming stores, which may result in write-offs. The success of
      our
      growth strategy will depend upon a number of factors, including the
      identification of suitable markets and sites for new stores, negotiation of
      leases on acceptable terms, construction or renovation of sites in a timely
      manner at acceptable costs and maintenance of the productivity of our existing
      store base. We must be able to hire, train and retain competent managers and
      personnel and manage the systems and operational components of our growth.
      Our
      failure to open new stores on a timely basis, obtain acceptance in markets
      in
      which we currently have limited or no presence, attract qualified management
      and
      personnel or appropriately adjust operational systems and procedures would
      have
      an adverse effect on our growth prospects. There can be no assurance that we
      will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy of continuing to
      open
      stores or maintain our current growth levels. In addition, there can be no
      assurance that the opening of new stores in existing markets will not have
      an
      adverse effect on sales at existing stores in these markets. 

We
      rely on foreign sources of production.   

We
      purchase a significant portion of our apparel directly in foreign markets,
      including Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and indirectly through domestic
      vendors with foreign sources. We face a variety of risks generally associated
      with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad,
      including: 

political
                instability; 

increased
                security requirements applicable to imported
                goods; 

imposition
                or increases of duties, taxes and other charges on
                imports; 

imposition
                of quotas on imported merchandise; 

currency
                and exchange risks; 

delays
                in shipping; and 

increased
                costs of transportation. 

New
      initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of
      certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions
      that, if enacted, could increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers
      in such countries or restrict the importation of products from such countries.
      The future performance of our business will depend on foreign suppliers and
      may
      be adversely affected by the factors listed above, all of which are beyond
      our
      control. This may result in our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of
      merchandise or increase our cost, thereby negatively impacting sales, gross
      profit and net earnings. 

Our
      business would be severely disrupted if our distribution centers were to shut
      down.   

The
      distribution of our    dressbarn   
      products
      is centralized in one distribution center in Suffern, New York and the
      distribution of our    maurices   
      products
      is centralized in one distribution center in Des Moines, Iowa. Most of the
      merchandise we purchase is shipped directly to our distribution centers, where
      it is prepared for shipment to the appropriate stores. If either of these
      distribution centers were to shut down or lose significant capacity for any
      reason, our operations would likely be seriously disrupted. As a result, we
      could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with
      distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to
      reopen or replace either distribution center. 

13 

We
      depend on strip shopping center and mall traffic and our ability to identify
      suitable store locations.   

Our
      sales
      are dependent in part on a high volume of strip shopping center and mall
      traffic. Strip shopping center and mall traffic may be adversely affected by,
      among other things, economic downturns, the closing of anchor stores or changes
      in customer shopping preferences. A decline in the popularity of strip shopping
      center or mall shopping among our target customers could have a material adverse
      effect on customer traffic and reduce our sales and net earnings. 

To
      take
      advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of our customers,
      we
      need to maintain or acquire stores in desirable locations and competition for
      suitable store locations is intense. We cannot assure you that desirable store
      locations will continue to be available. 

Our
      management information systems may fail and cause disruptions in our
      business.   

We
      rely
      on our existing management information systems in operating and monitoring
      all
      major aspects of our business, including sales, warehousing, distribution,
      purchasing, inventory control, merchandising planning and replenishment, as
      well
      as various financial systems. Any disruption in the operation of our management
      information systems, or our failure to continue to upgrade, integrate or expend
      capital on such systems as our business expands, would have a material adverse
      effect on our business. We are implementing the Oracle Retail Merchandising
      System for the    dressbarn   
      segment.
      A version of this merchandising system is already utilized by our    maurices   
      segment.
      We expect to complete the implementation of the system by July 2007. We have
      engaged several third-party consulting firms to assist with the implementation.
      We have also dedicated several internal personnel on a part-time and a full-time
      basis to work on the implementation. The purpose of the Oracle Retail
      Merchandising system is to expand our capability to identify and analyze sales
      trends and consumer data, and achieve planning and inventory management
      improvements. Any delays or difficulties in implementing the Oracle Retail
      Merchandising System or integrating it with our other systems or any other
      disruptions affecting any of our information systems could have a material
      adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our
      business could suffer as a result of a manufacturer s inability to produce goods
      for us on time and to our specifications.   

We
      do not
      own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon
      independent third parties for the manufacture of all of the goods that we sell.
      Both domestic and international manufacturers manufacture these goods. The
      inability of a manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or to meet our
      standards could cause us to miss sales of seasonal items, which could have
      a
      material adverse effect on our sales, gross margins, financial condition and
      results of operations. 

Our
      business could suffer if we need to replace
      manufacturers.   

We
      compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers
      and import quota capacity. Many of our competitors have greater financial and
      other resources than we have and thus may have an advantage in the competition
      for production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand,
      or
      if an existing manufacturer of the goods that we sell must be replaced, we
      may
      have to increase purchases from our third-party manufacturers and we cannot
      guarantee we will be able to do so either at all or on terms that are acceptable
      to us. This may negatively affect our sales and net earnings. We enter into
      a
      number of purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery,
      method of payment, design and quality specifications and other standard industry
      provisions, but we do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None
      of the manufacturers we use produces products for us exclusively. 

Our
      business could suffer if one of the manufacturers of the goods that we sell
      fails to use acceptable labor practices.   

We
      require manufacturers of the goods that we sell to operate in compliance with
      applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating
      guidelines promote ethical business practices and our staff and our agents
      periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers,
      we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation
      of
      labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us, or the divergence
      of an independent manufacturer s labor practices from those generally accepted
      as ethical in the United States, could interrupt, or otherwise disrupt the
      shipment of products to us or damage our reputation, which may result in a
      decrease in customer traffic to our stores and adversely affect our sales and
      net earnings. 

14 

Our
      operating results fluctuate from season to season.   

We
      have
      historically experienced substantially lower earnings in our second fiscal
      quarter ending in January than during our other three fiscal quarters,
      reflecting the intense promotional atmosphere that characterizes the holiday
      shopping season.    maurices   
      has
      historically experienced losses or lower revenues in January, reflecting the
      decrease in demand following the holiday shopping season. In addition, our
      quarterly results of operations may fluctuate materially depending on, among
      other things, the number and timing of new store openings and store closings,
      net sales contributed by new stores, increases or decreases in comparable store
      sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in timing of certain holidays and
      changes in our merchandise mix. 

Existing
      and increased competition in the women s retail apparel industry may reduce our
      net revenues, profits and market share.   

The
      women s retail apparel industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily with
      department stores, off-price retailers, specialty stores, discount stores,
      mass
      merchandisers and Internet-based retailers, many of which have substantially
      greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Many department
      stores offer a broader selection of merchandise than we offer. In addition,
      many
      department stores continue to be promotional and reduce their selling prices,
      and in some cases are expanding into markets in which we have a significant
      market presence. As a result of this competition, including close-out sales
      and
      going-out-of-business sales by other women s apparel retailers, we may
      experience pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures and loss of
      market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
      financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because    maurices   
      competes
      in small markets, its operations may be adversely affected if a larger
      competitor were to open stores in a significant number of small markets where
         maurices   
      has
      stores.  

We
      depend on key personnel in order to support our existing business and future
      expansion and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit
      additional qualified personnel.   

Our
      success and our ability to execute our business strategy depend largely on
      the
      efforts of our management. The loss of the services of one or more of our key
      personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, as we may not
      be
      able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives
      on a
      timely basis. We compete for experienced personnel with companies who have
      greater financial resources than we do. If we fail to attract, motivate, and
      retain qualified personnel, it could harm our business and limit our ability
      to
      expand. 

A
      decline in general economic conditions may lead to reduced consumer demand
      for
      our apparel and accessories.   

Consumer
      spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are
      affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of
      employment, salaries, wage rates, the availability of consumer credit, consumer
      confidence, and consumer perception of economic conditions. A general slowdown
      in the United States economy and an uncertain economic outlook may adversely
      affect consumer spending habits and customer traffic, which may result in lower
      net sales by us. A prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse
      effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Failure
      to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could negatively
      impact our business, the price of our common stock, and market confidence in
      our
      reported financial information.    

We
      have
      remediated the reported material weakness in our internal controls over
      financial reporting as of July 29, 2006. We had previously concluded that a
      material weakness existed in our internal controls over financial reporting
      as
      of July 30, 2005. In order to meet the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
      of
      2002 in future periods, we must continuously document, test, monitor and enhance
      our internal controls over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that our
      disclosure controls, procedures and internal controls over financial reporting
      required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will prove to be adequate
      in the future. Any failure to maintain the effectiveness of internal controls
      over financial reporting or to comply with the requirements of the
      Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse impact on our business,
      our financial condition and the price of our common stock.

ITEM
      2.      PROPERTIES   

We
      lease
      all of our stores. Store leases generally have an initial term ranging from
      5 to
      10 years with one or more options to extend the lease. The table below, covering
      all locations leased by us on July 29, 2006, indicates the number of leases
      expiring during the period indicated and the number of expiring leases with
      and
      without renewal options:  

New
      store
      leases generally provide for a base rent of between $7 and $24 per square foot
      per annum. Most leases have formulas requiring the payment of a percentage
      of
      sales as additional rent, generally when sales reach specified levels. Our
      aggregate minimum rentals under operating leases in effect at July 29, 2006
      and
      excluding locations acquired after July 29, 2006, for Fiscal 2007, are
      approximately $124.3 million. In addition, we are also typically responsible
      under our store leases for our pro rata share of maintenance expenses and common
      charges in strip and outlet centers.  

Most
      of
      the store leases give us the right to terminate the lease at little or no cost
      if certain specified sales volumes are not achieved. This affords us greater
      flexibility to close underperforming stores. Usually these provisions are
      operative only during the first few years of the lease. 

Our
      investment in new stores consists primarily of inventory, leasehold
      improvements, fixtures and equipment. We often receive tenant improvement
      allowances from landlords to offset these initial investments. Our stores are
      typically profitable within the first 12 months of operation. 

We
      own a
      510,000 square foot office and distribution center in Suffern, New York.
  The
      Suffern facility consists of approximately 65 acres of land, with a current
      total of approximately 900,000 square feet of rentable distribution and office
      space, the majority of which is occupied by us. The remainder of the rentable
      square footage is 100% leased through 2012. The purchase of the Suffern facility
      was financed with a mortgage that is collateralized by a mortgage lien on the
      Suffern facility. Payments of principal and interest on the mortgage, which
      is a
      20-year fully amortizing loan with a fixed interest rate of 5.33%, are due
      monthly through July 2023. We receive rental income and reimbursement for taxes
      and common area maintenance charges from two tenants that occupy the Suffern
      facility that are not affiliated with us. The rental income from the other
      tenants is shown as  other income  on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
      We own    maurices    
      corporate headquarters in downtown Duluth, Minnesota, which is composed of
      three
      adjacent office buildings totaling 150,564 square feet. We also own    maurices    
      distribution center, which has 360,000 square feet of space and is located
      in
      Des Moines, Iowa.  

ITEM
      3.      LEGAL

      the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty, in our opinion,
      dispositions of these matters are not expected to have a material adverse affect
      on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM
      7.      MANAGEMENT'S
      DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
      OPERATIONS   

The
      following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
      financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report
      on
      Form 10-K. Fiscal 2006 refers to the 52-week period ended July 29, 2006, Fiscal
      2005 refers to the 52-week period ended July 30, 2005, and Fiscal 2004 refers
      to
      the 53-week period ended July 31, 2004. Fiscal 2007 refers to our 52-week period
      that will end on July 28, 2007.    

All
      prior
      period common stock and share and per share amounts have been adjusted to
      reflect a two-for-one split of the Company s common stock effective April 3,
      2006.  

As
      more
      fully discussed below in Note 1 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial
      statements, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
      No.
      123R, Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123R ), effective July 31, 2005.  We
      adopted the modified prospective transition method provided under SFAS No.
      123R
      and consequently have not retroactively adjusted results for prior
      periods. 

Overview   

This
      Management Overview section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Condition and Results of Operations provides a high-level summary of the more
      detailed information elsewhere in this annual report and an overview to put
      this
      information into context. This section is also an introduction to the discussion
      and analysis that follows. Accordingly, it necessarily omits details that appear
      elsewhere in this annual report. It should not be relied upon separately from
      the balance of this annual report. 

We
      operate a chain of primarily women s apparel specialty stores, operating
      principally under the names     dressbarn    
and
          dressbarn       woman    
and,
      since our January 2005 acquisition of Maurices Incorporated,     maurices   . 
Our
         dressbarn   
      stores
      are operated mostly in a combination of    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores,
      or Combo stores, which carry    dressbarn   
      and
      larger-sized    dressbarn       woman   
      merchandise, as well as freestanding    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores.
      These stores offer in-season, moderate to better quality career and casual
      fashion to the working woman at value prices. Our    maurices   
      stores
      are concentrated in small markets in the United States and their product
      offerings are designed to appeal to the apparel and accessory needs of the
      17 to
      34 year-old woman and the casual apparel needs of the 17 to 34 year-old male.

The
      retail environment remains very competitive. With the acquisition of
 maurices , we have diversified our core business and believe it
      will improve our future growth potential. The addition of    maurices   
      has
      allowed us to broaden our demographic reach and diversify our retail base.
      We
      expect to continue our strategy of opening new stores while closing
      under-performing locations. We expect to continue store expansion focusing
      on
      both expanding in our major trading markets and developing and expanding into
      new domestic markets.  
      For
      Fiscal 2007, we are currently projecting net square footage growth in the mid
      single-digit percentage range.    

Customer
      tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly. Our success
      depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing
      fashion trends and consumer demands, and to translate market trends into
      appropriate, saleable product offerings. If we are unable to successfully
      predict or respond to changing styles or trends and misjudge the market for
      our
      products or any new product lines, our sales will be lower and we may be faced
      with a substantial amount of unsold inventory. In response, we may be forced
      to
      rely on additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or
      slow-moving inventory, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial
      condition or results of operations. 

We
      consider comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current
      performance. Comparable store sales results are important in leveraging our
      costs, including store payroll, store supplies and rent. Positive comparable
      store sales contribute to greater leveraging of costs. Comparable store sales
      also have a direct impact on our total net sales, cash and working capital.

We
      calculate comparable store sales based on the sales of stores open throughout
      the full period and throughout the full prior period (including stores relocated
      within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions).
      If a single-format store is converted into a Combo store, the additional sales
      from the incremental format are not included in the calculation of same store
      sales. The determination of which stores are included in the comparable store
      sales calculation only changes at the beginning of each fiscal year except
      for
      stores that close during the fiscal year which are excluded from comparable
      store sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually
      closes.   
      maurices    comparable
      store sales for Fiscal 2006 were calculated in the same manner as    dressbarn   
      using
      historical pre-acquisition and post-acquisition data for the comparable Fiscal
      2005 period.  

21 

Management
      uses a number of key indicators of financial condition and operating performance
      to evaluate the performance of our business, including the
      following: 

We
      include in our cost of sales line item all costs of merchandise (net of purchase
      discounts and vendor allowances), freight on inbound, outbound and internally
      transferred merchandise, merchandise acquisition costs (primarily commissions
      and import fees), occupancy costs excluding utilities and depreciation and
      all
      costs associated with the buying and distribution functions. Our cost of sales
      and gross profit may not be comparable to those of other entities, since some
      entities include all costs related to their distribution network and all buying
      and occupancy costs in their cost of sales, while other entities, including
      us,
      exclude a portion of these expenses from cost of sales and include them in
      selling, general and administrative expenses or depreciation. We include
      depreciation related to the distribution network in depreciation and
      amortization, and utilities and insurance expenses, among other expenses, in
      selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements
      of
      earnings. 

We
      believe that    maurices   
      is a
      reportable segment due to management s review of    maurices    
      separately available operating results and other financial information used
      to
      regularly assess their performance for decision-making purposes.    maurices   
      is
      discussed separately in the following   Management s
      Discussion and Analysis, a  s
      appropriate.  

Results
      of Operations    

The
      table
      below sets forth certain financial data expressed as a percentage of our net
      sales for the periods indicated: 

22 

Fiscal
      2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005   

Net
      Sales  

Net
        sales
        for the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006 increased 30.0% to $1,300.3 million
        from $1,000.3 million in the prior year. This increase was mainly driven
        by the
        acquisition of    maurices   
        as well
        as by the    dressbarn   
        same
        store sales increase of 9.9%.   The
        same
        store sales increase was the result of several factors including increased
        customer traffic to our stores and more customer transactions. We believe
        the
        increase in the number of customer transactions was the result of continuing
        customer acceptance of our more updated and fashionable merchandise assortment
        and targeted marketing and store presentation efforts.   The
        fifty-two weeks ended July 30, 2005 only include 30 weeks of    maurices   
        sales
        results. The acquisition was completed as of January 1, 2005. Details by
        brand
        are as follows: 

During
      the fifty-two week period, the    dressbarn   
      brand
      had a solid sales performance showing sales strength across all regions of
      the
      country, delivering the tenth consecutive quarter of positive comparable store
      sales. On a divisional basis, comparable store sales for the fifty-two week
      period increased 7.2% for    dressbarn   
      and
      15.0% for    dressbarn
      woman   .
        All
      regions posted increased comparable store sales for the fifty-two week period.
      The best performing departments were Blouses, Knits and Outerwear. The weakest
      departmental performers were Suits, Coordinates and Sweaters.  

For
      the
   maurices   
      brand,
      the Southwest (45 stores) and the Northwest (52 stores) led regional
      performance. Strong sales trends were noted for Studio Y, Knit Tops and Jewelry.

Gross
      Profit  

Gross
      profit, net of buying and occupancy costs, increased 260 basis points from
      37.9%
      of net sales in the prior year period. For the    dressbarn   
      brand,
      gross profit was 40.3% of net sales, an increase of 250 basis points as compared
      with the same period last year. Merchandise margins increased to 56.2% from
      55.0% last year mainly due to lower markdowns. The leveraging of store occupancy
      costs was achieved due to the comparable store sales performance of 9.9%. For
      the    maurices   
      brand,
      gross profit for Fiscal 2006 was $173.6 million or 40.9% of net sales as
      compared to $81.2 million or 38.3% of net sales in Fiscal 2005, which only
      included 30 weeks of    maurices   
      results.
      The increase in gross margin was the result of increased markon and lower
      markdowns as well as leveraging occupancy, buying and distribution center
      costs. 

SG A  

As
      a
      percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG A )
      decreased 150 basis points to 27.2% of net sales versus 28.7% last year. On
      a
      divisional basis,    dressbarn   
      SG A
      decreased 120 basis points to 28.1% of net sales versus 29.3% last year. The
      decrease was due primarily to leveraging of payroll related expenses (40 basis
      points) as a result of our 9.9% comparable store sales performance, coupled
      with
      total dollar decreases in advertising expense (20 basis points), supplies
      expense (10 basis points), telephone expenses (10 basis points), credit card
      and
      bank charges (10 basis points) and other category costs (40 basis points) for
      the 52 week period.    maurices   
      SG A
      was $106.9 million or 25.2% of net sales for the Fiscal 2006 as compared to
      $56.1 million or 26.4% in Fiscal 2005, which only includes 30 weeks of
   maurices   
      results.
      The decrease was due to the strong store selling productivity, coupled with
      reduced credit card processing rates, and other leveraged overheads. These
      savings were partially offset by higher Sarbanes-Oxley compliance costs. Our
      adoption of SFAS No. 123R resulted in the recording of compensation expense
      of
      $4.4 million for share-based payments (stock options and restricted stock)
      in
      Fiscal 2006, partially offsetting the decrease in SG A. We continue to focus
      on controlling our costs and enhancing productivity, which we believe will
      improve SG A expense as a percentage of sales in the future.  

Depreciation
      and Amortization  

Depreciation
      expense for the fifty-two week period was $41.7 million, an increase of $7.2
      million from last year. This increase resulted primarily from the addition
      of
   maurices   .
         maurices    
      depreciation expense was $15.8 million for Fiscal 2006 (52 weeks) as compared
      to
      $9.4 million in Fiscal 2005 (30 weeks). 

Interest
      Income  

Interest
      income for the fifty-two week period was $2.7 million as compared to interest
      income of $1.7 million last year. The increase was due to the increase in funds
      invested in marketable securities and investments over the fiscal year as
      compared to Fiscal 2005.  

23 

Interest
      Expense  

Interest
      expense for the fiscal year decreased to $5.4 million from $10.2 million due
      to
      lower average debt levels over the comparable prior year period. We acquired
       maurices  in Fiscal 2005. Part of the funds for this investment
      were raised by issuance of $115 million of convertible senior notes, and $100
      million borrowed under the Senior Credit Facility, as described in Note 5 to
      the
      consolidated financial statements. In Fiscal 2006, we repaid the remaining
      $10
      million under the $100 million Senior Credit Facility.    

Other
      Income  

Other
      income for the fiscal year was $1.5 million. This amount represents rental
      income from the two tenants currently occupying space in our Corporate
      Headquarters property in Suffern, New York. 

Income
      Taxes  

The
      effective tax rate for Fiscal 2006 increased to 39.6%, as compared to 38.7%
      in
      Fiscal 2005. The effective rate increased primarily as a result of the recording
      permanent differences for compensation expense related to incentive stock
      options as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, reserves for various tax
      related exposures, and more nondeductible expense in Fiscal 2006 for such items
      as officers life insurance premiums and travel and entertainment expenditures.
      Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details
      of our income tax amounts.  

Fiscal
      2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004   

Net
      Sales  

Our
      results for Fiscal 2005 were favorably impacted by the acquisition of
 maurices  in January 2005. Net sales increased by 32.5% to $1
      billion in Fiscal 2005, from $755 million in Fiscal 2004. The following table
      details the net sales by brand: 

The
      net
      sales increase from fiscal 2004 was mainly due to the accretive impact of the
      acquisition of  maurices  coupled with a 5.0% increase in total
      company same store sales. Same store sales are the primary means most retailers
      use to evaluate their sales performance. The same store sales increase was
      the
      result of several factors including increased customer traffic to our stores
      and
      more customer transactions. We believe the increase in the number of customer
      transactions was the result of continuing customer acceptance of our more
      updated and fashionable merchandise assortment and intensified marketing and
      store presentation efforts. Among the categories that helped increase net sales
      were jewelry, knitwear, blouses and woven tops. 

Gross
      Profit  

Gross
      profit (net sales less cost of goods sold, including occupancy and buying
      costs), increased 33.9% to $378.6 million, or 37.9% of net sales, in Fiscal
      2005
      from $282.7 million, or 37.4% of net sales in Fiscal 2004. The increase in
      gross
      profit as a percentage of net sales is due to increased sales in higher margin
      categories such as jewelry, the leverage on buying costs gained from the
      acquisition of  maurices  and increased same store sales.
      Excluding the fifty-third week from Fiscal 2004, gross profit would have been
      $276.9 million, or 37.3% of net sales.  

SG A  

SG A
      expenses increased to $286.8 million, or 28.7% of net sales in Fiscal 2005
      from
      $212.5 million or 28.1% of net sales in Fiscal 2004. The increase of 60 basis
      points was primarily driven by an increase in management incentive compensation
      and increased costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. Excluding the
      fifty-third week from Fiscal 2004, SG A would have been $209.2 million, or
      28.1% of net sales 

Depreciation
      and Amortization  

Depreciation
      expense increased to $34.5 million in Fiscal 2005, versus $23.2 million in
      Fiscal 2004. The increase was largely the result of the acquisition of
 maurices  in January 2005. Depreciation expense for    maurices   
      was $9.4
      million in Fiscal 2005.  

24 

Litigation

As
      a
      result of   the
      Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision to reverse an approximately $32 million
      jury verdict, we reversed the litigation charge incurred when the judgment
      was
      entered in Fiscal 2003. The judgment was subject to post-judgment interest
      at
      the rate of 10% per annum, which we accrued. Following the reversal of the
      judgment the escrow account established in connection with the appeal, which
      included the post-judgment interest, was released, resulting in $35.3 million
      of
      income to us in Fiscal 2005, which included the interest paid into the escrow
      fund. Refer to Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for further
      details of this litigation. 

Interest
      Income  

Interest
      income decreased to $1.7 million for Fiscal 2005 from $2.2 million for Fiscal
      2004. The decrease was due to the reduction of interest earned from investments
      in marketable securities, which were liquidated during Fiscal 2005. The proceeds
      from the sales of marketable securities were used in the acquisition of
 maurices .  

Interest
      Expense  

Interest
      expense for Fiscal 2005 was $10.2 million as compared to $1.9 million in Fiscal
      2004. The increase is primarily due to the issuance of $115 million of 2.50%
      Convertible Senior Notes in December 2004 and borrowings under a Senior Secured
      Credit Facility. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
      The
      remaining interest expense represents the mortgage interest from the financing
      of our Suffern facility in July 2003 (a 5.3% fixed rate over a 20 year term).

Other
      Income  

Other
      income for Fiscal 2005 remained at $1.5 million, which is the same as Fiscal
      2004. Other income represents income from unaffiliated tenants of our
  distribution/office
      facility in Suffern, New York. 

Income
      Taxes  

The
      effective tax rate for Fiscal 2005 was 38.7% versus 32.0% in Fiscal 2004. The
      increase in effective tax rate is mainly due to prior year favorable resolution
      of certain tax audits, which reduced the effective tax rate in Fiscal 2004.
      We
      also had less tax-free interest in Fiscal 2005 because of the sales of municipal
      bond investments, the proceeds of which were used in the acquisition of
 maurices . Our effective tax rate was also influenced by the
      reversal of the litigation charge in Fiscal 2005. Refer to Note 9 to the
      consolidated financial statements for additional details of our income tax
      amounts.  

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources   

We
      invested $328 million in connection with our acquisition of  maurices
 in Fiscal 2005. The funds for this investment were raised
      by issuance
      of $115 million of convertible senior notes, $100 million borrowed under the
      Senior Credit Facility, as described in Note 5 to Consolidated Financial
      Statements and below, and the proceeds from the sale of marketable securities.
      In Fiscal 2006, we repaid $100 million of the Senior Credit Facility.

At
      July
      29, 2006, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable
      securities of $153 million as compared to $43 million as of July 30, 2005.
      The
      increase in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities
      was primarily driven by generation of operating cash flows.  

Net
      cash
      provided by operations was $164 million for the   fifty-two
      weeks ended July 29, 2006   compared
      with $106 million during last year s comparable period.   The
      increase in cash flow from operations is primarily due to the accretive effect
      of the acquisition of Maurices Incorporated and the improved cash flows
      generated from    dressbarn   .
        Cash
      flows from operating activities for the period were primarily generated by
      income from operations, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, and a tax
      benefit related to share-based compensation and changes in working capital
      account balances, specifically the increase in trade accounts payable, income
      taxes payable, accrued salaries and wages and customer credits, offset by the
      increase in merchandise inventories and prepaid expenses.  

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities was $170 million for the fifty-two weeks ended
      July
      29, 2006.   We  
      made net
      investments of $119 million in marketable securities and investments as of
      July
      29, 2006. We also purchased $48 million of property and equipment mainly for
      new
      store openings during Fiscal 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was
      $3
      million for the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006. We made $11 million of
      principal payments owed under long-term debt agreements. $10 million of these
      payments represented the final repayment of principal of the term loan that
      was
      outstanding at July 30, 2005 that was utilized in our acquisition of
   maurices   .
      We also
      received approximately $6 million from the proceeds of stock options exercises.

25 

As
      of
      July 29, 2006, $37 million was available under a revolving credit facility
      that
      was part of a credit agreement executed in December 2005 for future borrowings,
      which we believe gives us ample capacity to fund any short-term working capital
      needs that may arise in the operation of our business. The $37 million available
      under the credit agreement represents the $100 million from our revolving credit
      facility less $63 million of outstanding letters of credit at July 29, 2006.
      We
      also have an option to increase the revolving credit facility by $50 million.

We
      do not
      have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related
      persons or entities. We held no material options or other derivative instruments
      at July 29, 2006. We  
      do not
      have any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated,
      limited purpose entities. In the normal course of business, we enter into
      operating leases for our store locations and utilize letters of credit
      principally for the importation of merchandise.  

Dunnigan
      Realty, LLC receives rental income and reimbursement for taxes and common area
      maintenance charges from two tenants that occupy the Suffern facility that
      are
      not affiliated with us. These unaffiliated rental payments are used to offset
      the mortgage payments and planned capital and maintenance expenditures for
      the
      Suffern facility.  

In
      January 2003, Dunnigan Realty, LLC, a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary
      of
      the Company, purchased the Suffern facility, of which the major portion is
      our
      corporate offices and    dressbarn   
      distribution center, for approximately $45.3 million utilizing internally
      generated funds. In July 2003, Dunnigan Realty, LLC borrowed $34.0 million
      with
      a 5.33% rate mortgage loan. The mortgage has a twenty-year term with annual
      payments of $2.8 million including principal and interest and is secured by
      a
      first mortgage lien on the Suffern facility.  

In
      Fiscal
      2007, we plan to open approximately 105 additional stores and continue our
      store
      remodeling program. Total Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures, which are primarily
      attributable to our store opening, renovation and refurbishment programs, and
      implementation of the Oracle Retail Merchandising System for the    dressbarn   
      segment,
      are expected to be approximately $60 million. We intend to focus on both
      expanding in existing major trading markets and developing and expanding into
      new markets.  

We
        have a
        $75 million stock repurchase program that was announced in 2001. As of the
        date
        of this filing, the Company had repurchased 4,885,400 shares at an aggregate
        purchase price of approximately $26.7 million. At July 29, 2006, we had $48.3
        million of repurchase availability remaining. Purchases of shares of the
        Company s common stock will be made at our discretion from time to time, subject
        to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market
        purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.  

We
      believe that our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flow
      from operations, along with the credit agreement mentioned above, will be
      adequate to fund our planned capital expenditures and all other operating
      requirements and other proposed or contemplated expenditures for the next 12
      fiscal months.  

Contractual
      Obligations and Commercial Commitments   

The
      estimated significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial
      commitments at July 29, 2006 are summarized in the following table:

Holders
      of the Convertible Senior Notes may convert their notes into cash and shares
      of
      our common stock at a conversion rate of 95.1430 shares per $1,000 principal
      amount of Convertible Senior Notes (equal to a conversion price of approximately
      $10.51 per share), during specified periods, if the price of our common stock
      reaches, or the trading price of the convertible notes falls below, specified
      thresholds, or upon the event of certain Company transactions. As of July 31,
      2006 and continuing through October 27, 2006, the holders of the Convertible
      Senior Notes may convert their notes as described above because our stock price
      closed at or above $12.61 per share for twenty trading days within the
      thirty-trading-day period ending on July 28, 2006. Upon conversion, we would
      deliver cash to the extent of the aggregate principal amount of Convertible
      Senior Notes to be converted and our conversion obligation. The excess, if
      any,
      of the price of our common stock above $10.51 per share would be payable in
      common shares. Therefore as holders of the Convertible Senior Notes elect to
      convert their notes, the principal amount of the notes would be currently
      payable and subsequent associated interest payments would be relinquished.

26 

The
      operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under
      non-cancelable operating leases as of July 29, 2006. The minimum lease payments
      do not include common area maintenance ( CAM ) charges or real estate taxes,
      which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases.
      In
      the majority of our operating leases, CAM charges are not fixed and can
      fluctuate from year to year. Total CAM charges and real estate taxes for Fiscal
      2005 were $32.2 million. Total CAM charges and real estate taxes for the Fiscal
      2006 were $36.5 million. 

In
      addition to the commitments represented in the above table, we enter into a
      number of cancelable and non-cancelable commitments during the year. Typically,
      these commitments are for less than a year in duration and are principally
      focused on the construction of new retail stores and the procurement of
      inventory. We do not maintain any long-term or exclusive commitments or
      arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier. Preliminary
      commitments with our private label merchandise vendors typically are made five
      to seven months in advance of planned receipt date. Substantially all of our
      merchandise purchase commitments are cancelable up to 30 days prior to the
      vendor s scheduled shipment date. 

Seasonality      

The
         dressbarn   
      and
   maurices   
      brands
      have historically experienced substantially lower earnings in our second fiscal
      quarter ending in January than during our other three fiscal quarters,
      reflecting the intense promotional atmosphere that has characterized the holiday
      shopping season in recent years. We expect this trend to continue for Fiscal
      2007. In addition, our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate materially
      depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in same store sales,
      adverse weather conditions, shifts in timing of certain holidays, the timing
      of
      new store openings, net sales contributed by new stores, and changes in our
      merchandise mix. 

Critical
      Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
      accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Consolidated
      Financial Statements. Management s discussion and analysis of our financial
      condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
      statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
      generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
      financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
      the
      reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, income taxes
      and
      related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis,
      we evaluate estimates, including those related primarily to merchandise
      inventories, long-lived assets, insurance reserves, income taxes, stock-based
      employee compensation, claims and contingencies and litigation. We base our
      estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
      believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
      the
      basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
      that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
      from
      these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes
      the following accounting principles are the most critical because they involve
      the most significant judgments, assumptions and estimates used in preparation
      of
      our financial statements. 

Revenue
      Recognition   

While
      our
      recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment, revenue
      recognition represents an important accounting policy of ours. As discussed
      in
      Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recognize sales at the
      point
      of purchase when the customer takes possession of the merchandise and pays
      for
      the purchase, generally with cash or credit card. Sales from purchases made
      with
      gift certificates and layaway sales are also recorded when the customer takes
      possession of the merchandise. Gift certificates and merchandise credits do
      not
      have expiration dates and our policy is not to reduce the liability for
      unredeemed gift certificates or merchandise credits that will eventually be
      remitted to the states under their escheat laws until such time as amounts
      are
      remitted to a state. We have reserved for estimated product returns when sales
      are recorded based on historical return trends and adjusted for known events,
      as
      applicable. 

27 

Merchandise
      Inventories  

Our
      inventory is valued using the retail method of accounting and is stated at
      the
      lower of cost, on a First In First Out ( FIFO ) basis, or market. Under the
      retail inventory method, the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross
      margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the
      retail value of inventory. The retail inventory method is an averaging method
      that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. We
      include in the cost of sales line item all costs of merchandise (net of purchase
      discounts and vendor allowances), freight on inbound, outbound and internally
      transferred merchandise, merchandise acquisition costs, primarily commissions
      and import fees, all occupancy costs excluding depreciation and all costs
      associated with our buying and distribution functions. Inherent in the retail
      method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including,
      among others, initial merchandise markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which
      significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the
      resulting gross margins. Physical inventories are conducted in the fourth
      quarter to calculate actual shrinkage and inventory on hand. Estimates are
      used
      to charge inventory shrinkage for the first, second, and third fiscal quarters
      of the fiscal year. We continuously review our inventory levels to identify
      slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments, using markdowns to clear
      merchandise. A provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its
      estimated net realizable value. Consideration is given to a number of
      quantitative factors, including anticipated subsequent markdowns and aging
      of
      inventories. To the extent that actual markdowns are higher or lower than
      estimated, our gross margins could increase or decrease and, accordingly, affect
      our financial position and results of operations. A significant variation
      between the estimated provision and actual results could have a substantial
      impact on our results of operations.  

Impairment
      of Long-lived Assets  

We
      primarily invest in property and equipment in connection with the opening and
      remodeling of stores. When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying
      values of such long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
      recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets
      to
      projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative
      analyses. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be
      recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against current
      operations. Property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for
      which there is identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment, which
      is the individual store level.   Judgments
      made by us related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and our
      ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts
      of
      such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and
      improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in
      operating performance. As we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying
      amounts of our long-lived assets, these factors could cause us to realize
      material impairment charges.  
      In
      addition, we regularly evaluate our computer-related and other assets and may
      accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset is no longer
      in use or has limited future value.  

Insurance
      Reserves  

We
        use a
        combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for the
        potential liabilities for workers  compensation and employee healthcare
        benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are
        estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic
        factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Such liabilities
        are
        capped through the use of stop loss contracts with insurance companies. The
        estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected
        if
        future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical
        trends. As of July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005, these reserves were $7.8 million
        and $8.3 million, respectively  .
          We
        are
        subject to various claims and contingencies related to insurance and other
        matters arising out of the normal course of business. We are self-insured
        for
        expenses related to our employee medical and dental plans, and our workers 
compensation plan, up to certain thresholds. Claims filed, as well as claims
        incurred but not reported, are accrued based on management s estimates, using
        information received from plan administrators, historical analysis and other
        relevant data. We have stop-loss insurance coverage for individual claims
        in
        excess of $250,000. We believe our accruals for claims and contingencies
        are
        adequate based on information currently available. However, it is possible
        that
        actual results could significantly differ from the recorded accruals for
        claims
        and contingencies. 

28 

Goodwill
      and other intangible assets  

Goodwill
      represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of net
      identifiable assets acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards No. 142,    Goodwill
      and Other Intangible Assets   ,
      (SFAS
      No. 142) we do not amortize goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives
      but, rather, we are required to evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with
      indefinite lives annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances
      indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The conditions that
      would trigger an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite
      lives include a significant, sustained negative trend in    maurices    
      operating results or cash flows, a decrease in demand for    maurices   
      products, a change in the competitive environment or other industry and economic
      factors. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated
      for
      impairment annually under the provisions of SFAS No. 142. Our annual assessment
      date is on or about June 30   th   .
      In
      addition, while we have concluded that the fair value of goodwill and other
      intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeds the carrying value as of July
      29, 2006, changes in    maurices   
      estimated future cash flows could require us to record impairment charges on
      these assets.     

Operating
      Leases  

We
      lease
      retail stores under operating leases. Most lease agreements contain  
      construction allowances, rent holidays, lease premiums, rent escalation clauses
      and/or contingent rent provisions. For purposes of recognizing incentives,
      premiums and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms
      of
      the leases, we use the date of initial possession to begin amortization, which
      is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in
      preparation of intended use. 

For
      construction allowances and rent holidays, we record a deferred rent liability
      in  Other accrued expenses  and  Deferred rent  on the consolidated balance
      sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions
      to  Cost of sales including occupancy and buying costs  on the consolidated
      statements of earnings. 

For
      scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments
      commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, we record minimum
      rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases on the
      consolidated statements of earnings.  

Certain
      leases provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of
      gross sales in excess of specified levels. We record a contingent rent liability
      in  Other accrued expenses  on the consolidated balance sheets and the
      corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when
      management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal
      year
      is probable.  

Income
      Taxes   

We
      do
      business in various jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Management
      determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount
      currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each jurisdiction. This process
      involves adjusting income determined using generally accepted accounting
      principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing
      authorities. Deferred taxes are provided using the asset and liability method,
      whereby deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the
      reported amounts in the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and
      liabilities, as measured by current tax rates. We establish valuation allowances
      against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the realization
      of those deferred tax assets will not occur. We accrue for estimates of probable
      settlements of Federal and State tax audits when they are more likely than
      not
      to be settled. At any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various
      taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing
      authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. We believe
      our
      accruals for claims and contingencies are adequate based on information
      currently available. However, it is possible that actual results could
      significantly differ from the recorded accruals for claims and
      contingencies. 

ITEM
      7A.      QUANTITATIVE
      AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Our
      portfolio of investments consisting of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
      securities can be affected by changes in market interest rates. Financial
      instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk,
      are
      principally bank deposits and short-term money market investments. Cash and
      cash
      equivalents are deposited with high credit quality financial institutions.
      Short-term investments principally consist of triple A or double A rated
      instruments. The carrying amounts of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
      investments and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the
      short-term nature and maturity of such instruments.  

29 

Currently,
      we maintain the vast majority of our cash and investments in financial
      instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less. We do not
      believe that an adverse change in interest rates would have a material affect
      on
      our financial condition. 

Our
      outstanding long-term liabilities as of July 29, 2006 consisted of $29.8 million
      of our 5.3% mortgage loan due July 1, 2023. As the mortgage loan bears interest
      at a fixed rate, our results of operations would not be affected by interest
      rate changes.  

On
      December 15, 2004, we issued $115 million of convertible senior notes. As the
      convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our results of
      operations would not be affected by interest rate changes.     On
      July
      28, 2006, the market value of the Convertible Senior Notes was $242.1 million
      as
      valued on PORTAL (Private Offering Resale and Trading through Automated
      Linkage). 

We
      also
      entered into a $100 million Credit Agreement with a group of banks on December
      21, 2005. Under that Credit Agreement, we have available a revolving credit
      facility with borrowings of up to $100 million at a variable rate. At July
      29,
      2006, we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
      As
      of July 29, 2006, $37 million was available under the revolving credit facility.
      The $37 million available under the revolving credit facility represents the
      $100 million less $63 million of outstanding letters of credit at July 29,
      2006.

We
      hold
      no material options or other derivative instruments at July 29, 2006.

Accordingly,
      we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect
      to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure
      under
      this item.

        procedures  ,
        including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding
        of
        the controls and procedures.   Accordingly,
        even effective   disclosure  
        controls
  and
        procedures  
        can only
        provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives  .
        Based
        on such evaluation, the  
        Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer  
        concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
        the
        end of the period covered by this report in alerting them on a timely basis
        to
        material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries)
        required to be included in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
        Act. 

(b)
        Management s Report of Internal Control    
        over Financial Reporting  

Management
        is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal   control
        over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a 5(f) and 15d 5(f) under the
        Exchange Act. Our internal control system over financial reporting is designed
        to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations,
        internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
        misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
        periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
        of
        changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
        or
        procedures may deteriorate  .

Management
        has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
        as of July 29, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria
        established in    Internal
        Control - Integrated Framework    issued
        by  
        the
        Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
        (COSO)  .
        Based
        on the assessment and those criteria, management believes that we maintained
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2006.
          Our
        independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report
        on management s assessment of our internal   control  
        over
        financial reporting. T  hat  
        report
        appears herein below.

(c)
      Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting   

During
        the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, we completed the remediation of a material
        weakness identified as of July 30, 2005 in our internal control over financial
        reporting that related to the design and operation of certain of our controls
        with respect to the preparation and review of financial statements. The
        deficiencies identified resulted from inadequate resources in the financial
        reporting and income tax departments and lack of appropriate technical training
        of such resources in matters relating to the preparation of the financial
        statements and footnotes and the accounting for income taxes.     
        The
        steps we took in connection with the remediation included hiring additional
        personnel, engaging third-party tax, financial and financial systems
        consultants, improving quality control standards, and providing additional
        training and education to our financial reporting and accounting personnel.

As
        a
        result of the steps we have taken as of July 29, 2006, we have made changes
        to
        controls with respect to the process of preparing and reviewing our financial
        statements.

        Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
        Over
        Financial Reporting   

REPORT
      OF
      INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

      To
      the
      Board of Directors and Stockholders of  

      The
      Dress
      Barn, Inc. 

      Suffern,
      New York  

We
      have
      audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management s
      Report of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, which is included in Item
      9A(b), that The Dress Barn, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) maintained
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2006 based
      on
      criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
      Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's
      management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
      financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
      control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
      on
      management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's
      internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

A
      company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by,
      or
      under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
      financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
      the
      company's board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide
      reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
      preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
      generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements. 

Because
      of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
      including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of
      controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented
      or
      detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
      effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
      are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of
      changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
      procedures may deteriorate.  

In
      our
      opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
      control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2006, is fairly stated, in
      all
      material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
      Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
      of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
      all
      material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
      July 29, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
      Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
      Commission. 

We
        have
        also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of
        the
        Company as of and for the  
        fiscal  
        year
        ended July 29, 2006, and our report dated October 11, 2006 expressed an
        unqualified opinion on those   consolidated
          financial
        statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company s
  adoption
        of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment,"
        as of July 31, 2005.

REPORT
      OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     

To
      the Board of Directors and Stockholders of     

       The
      Dress Barn, Inc.  

       Suffern,
      New York     

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Dress Barn, Inc.
      and
      subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005, and the
      related consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders  equity and
      comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in
      the period ended July 29, 2006. These financial statements are the
      responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an
      opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.  

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
        our
        opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
        respects, the financial position of the Company and subsidiaries as of July
        29,
        2006 and July 30, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
        flows
        for each of the three fiscal   years  
        in the
  period  
        ended
        July 29, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
        in
        the United States of America. 

As
        discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
        adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),  Share-Based
        Payment,  as of July 31, 2005. 

We
      have
      also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company s internal
      control over financial reporting as of July 29, 2006, based on the criteria
      established in    Internal
      Control   Integrated Framework    issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
      report dated October 11, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management s
      assessment of the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial
      reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s
      internal control over financial reporting.

Business  

The
      Dress
      Barn, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the  Company,   we,   our,  or
      similar terms) operate a chain of women's apparel specialty stores. The stores

      and
      larger-sized    dressbarn       woman   
      merchandise, as well as freestanding    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores.
      These stores offer in-season, moderate to better quality career and casual
      fashion to the working woman at value prices. The    dressbarn   
      brands
      primarily attract female consumers in the mid 30 s to mid 50 s age range. The
   maurices   
      stores
      are concentrated in small markets (having populations of approximately 25,000
      to
      100,000) in the United States and offer moderately priced, up-to-date fashions
      designed to appeal to    maurices    
target
      customers, the 17 to 34 year-old female as well as the causal apparel needs
      of
      the 17 to 34 year-old male.   During
      the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2005, we concluded that we should disclose
      reportable segments to reflect the impact of our acquisition of Maurices
      Incorporated.     

Basis
      of financial statement presentation   

The
        accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to the generally
        accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
          All
        prior
        period common stock and share and per share amounts have been adjusted to
        reflect a two-for-one split of the Company s common stock effective April 3,
        2006.   Certain
        reclassifications have been made to the prior years  consolidated financial
        statements to conform to the Company s Fiscal 2006 presentation. The Company
        revised the financial statements for 2005 and 2004 for amounts that were
        previously reported as a component of inflows and outflows of sales and
        purchases of marketable securities and investments that should not have been
        reported in the statements of cash flows. The Company's cash flow statements
        for
        fiscal years ended July 30, 2005 and July 31, 2004 have been revised to reflect
        a decrease in sales and purchases of marketable securities and investments
        of
        $41.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively. These revisions had no effect
        on
        net income, net cash flows used in investing activities or the amount of
        cash
        and cash equivalents reported. 

Principles
      of consolidation  

The
        consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
        its
        subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in
        consolidation. The Company reports on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on
        the
        last Saturday in July. Fiscal years 2006 and 2005 consisted of 52 weeks.
        Fiscal
        year ended July 31, 2004 consisted of 53 weeks.  

Dunnigan
      Realty, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was formed in Fiscal
      2003
      to purchase, own and operate a distribution/office facility in Suffern, New
      York
      (the  Suffern facility ), of which the major portion is the Company s corporate
      offices and    dressbarn   
      distribution center. Dunnigan Realty, LLC receives rental income and
      reimbursement for taxes and common area maintenance charges from the Company
      and
      two additional tenants that occupy the Suffern facility that are not affiliated
      with the Company. The rental income from the unaffiliated tenants is shown
      as
 other income  on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
      Intercompany rentals between the Company and Dunnigan Realty, LLC are eliminated
      in consolidation. 

Revenue
      recognition   

Revenues
        from retail sales, net of estimated returns, are recognized at the point
        of
        purchase upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer and exclude sales
        taxes. Sales from purchases made with gift certificates and layaway sales
        are
        also recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise. The
        Company s gift certificates and merchandise credits do not have expiration
        dates, and the Company s current policy is that it does not reduce its liability
        for unredeemed gift certificates or merchandise credits that will eventually
        be
        remitted to the states under their escheat laws until such time amounts are
        remitted to the state. The    maurices   
        segment
        of the Company charges its customers a small fee to offset shipping costs
        to
        move product from store to store for special order transactions. Amounts
        related
        to shipping and handling billed to customers as part of a sales transaction
        are
        classified as revenue. The Company records a reserve for estimated product
        returns   when
        sales are recorded   based
        on
        historical return trends   and
        adjusted for known events, as applicable  .
        The
        changes in the sales return reserve are summarized below:

Cost
      of Sales, Including Certain Buying, Occupancy and Warehousing
      Expenses   

Cost
        of
        sales consists of net merchandise costs, including design, sourcing, importing
        and inbound freight costs, as well as markdowns, shrinkage and promotional
        costs. Buying, occupancy and warehousing costs   consist  
        of
        compensation and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising
        executives; rent related to our stores, corporate headquarters, distribution
        centers and other office space; freight from our distribution centers to
        the
        stores; and compensation and supplies for our distribution centers, including
        purchasing, receiving and inspection costs.  

Selling,
      General and Administrative Expenses  

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and employee benefit
      expenses, other than for our design, sourcing and importing teams, our buyers
      and our distribution centers personnel. Such compensation and employee benefit
      expenses include salaries, incentives and related benefits associated with
      our
      stores and corporate headquarters, except as previously noted. Selling, general
      and administrative expenses also include advertising costs, supplies for our
      stores and home office, communication costs, travel and entertainment, leasing
      costs and services purchased. 

Cash
      and cash equivalents   

The  
        Company
        considers its highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
        less
        when purchased to be cash equivalents. These amounts are stated at cost,
        which
        approximates market value. The Company also considers receivables related
        to
        credit card purchases to be equivalent to cash. The majority of the Company s
        money market funds at July 29, 2006 were maintained with one financial
        institution.   The
        Company maintains its cash deposits and cash equivalents with well-known
        and
        stable financial institutions. However, it has significant amounts of cash
        and
        cash equivalents at these financial institutions that are in excess of federally
        insured limits. This represents a concentration of credit risk. The Company
        has
        not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents to
        date. 

Restricted
      cash   

At
      July
      29, 2006, restricted cash consisted of $100 thousand held in escrow as required
      as part of a pending lawsuit.  

Marketable
      securities and investments  

The
      Company has categorized its marketable securities as available for sale, stated
      at market value. The unrealized holding gains and losses are included in other
      comprehensive income, a component of shareholders  equity, until realized. The
      amortized cost is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to
      maturity, with the net amortization included in interest income.  

Merchandise
      inventories  

The
      Company values its merchandise inventories at the lower of cost, on a First
      In
      First Out (FIFO) basis, or market, as determined by the retail inventory method.
      The Company includes in cost of sales, including occupancy and buying costs,
      all
      costs of merchandise (net of purchase discounts and vendor allowances), all
      costs associated with its buying and distribution functions, freight on inbound,
      outbound and internally transferred merchandise, merchandise acquisition costs,
      commissions and import fees, and all occupancy costs excluding
      depreciation. 

Property
      and equipment  

Property
      and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
      of
      fixtures and equipment, and software is provided on the straight-line method
      over the estimated useful lives, generally ranging from 5 to 10 years and 25
      years for the building. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
      of
      their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years.
      For leases with renewal periods at the Company s option, the Company generally
      uses the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods to determine
      estimated useful lives; if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an
      economic penalty to the Company, management determines at the inception of
      the
      lease that renewal is reasonably assured and includes the renewal option period
      in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives. The costs of repairs
      and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for
      refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive
      capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.

Impairment
      of long-lived assets   

The
        Company primarily invests in property and equipment in connection with the
        opening and remodeling of stores. When facts and circumstances indicate that
        the
        carrying values of such long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation
        of
        recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets
        to
        projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative
        analyses. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not
        be
        recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against
        current operations. Property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest
        level for which there is identifiable cash flows when assessing
        impairment  ,
        which
        is  
        the
        individual store level. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected
        useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize
        undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets
        are
        affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the
        assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance.
          In
        addition, the Company regularly evaluates its computer-related and other
        assets
        and may accelerate depreciation over the revised useful life if the asset
        has
        limited future value.   Based
        on
        the review of certain under performing stores, the Company recorded impairment
        charges and store closings that are included in selling, general, and
        administrative expenses of $3.8 million in Fiscal   2006
        (   dressbarn   
        $2.7
        million,    maurices   
        $1.1
        million  ),  
        $6.1
        million  
        in
        Fiscal   2005
          (   dressbarn   
        $5.3
        million,    maurices   
        $0.8
        million  )
        and
        $4.9 million  
        in
        Fiscal   2004.  
        These
        impairment losses reflect the amount of book value over fair market value
        of
        store related assets in certain locations where market conditions limit the
        Company s ability to recover its investments. 

Costs
      of computer software  

We
      capitalize certain costs associated with computer software developed or obtained
      for internal use in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Position
      No
      98-1,  Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
      Internal Use  (SOP 98-1), issued by the American Institute of Certified Public
      Accountants (AICPA). We capitalize those costs from the acquisition of external
      materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use
      computer software. We capitalize certain payroll costs for employees that are
      directly associated with internal use computer software projects once specific
      criteria of SOP 98-1 are met. We expense those costs that are associated with
      preliminary stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other
      post-implementation stage activities as they are incurred. We amortize all
      costs
      capitalized in connection with internal use computer software projects on a
      straight-line basis over a useful life of five years, beginning when the
      software is ready for its intended use. 

Insurance
      reserves   

The
        Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to
        provide
        for the potential liabilities associated with workers  compensation and employee
        healthcare benefit claims. Liabilities associated with the risks that are
        retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical
        claims
        experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial
        assumptions. Such liabilities are capped through the use of stop loss contracts
        with insurance companies. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could
        be
        significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these
        assumptions and historical trends. As of July 29, 2006   and
        July
        30, 2005   these
        reserves were $7.8 million and   $8.3
        million,   respectively.

Income
      taxes  

The
      Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
      Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes .
      Deferred taxes are provided using the asset and liability method, whereby
      deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the reported
      amounts in the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities,
      as measured by presently enacted tax rates. The Company establishes valuation
      allowances against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that
      the
      realization of those deferred tax assets will not occur. 

Goodwill
      and other intangible assets   

Goodwill
        represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of net
        identifiable assets acquired. In accordance with   SFAS
          No.
        142,
   Goodwill
        and Other Intangible Assets   ,  
        the
        Company does not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite
        lives but, rather, it is required to evaluate goodwill and other intangible
        assets with indefinite lives annually or whenever events or changes in
        circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
        conditions that would trigger an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets
        with indefinite lives include a significant, sustained negative trend in
           maurices    
        operating results or cash flows, a decrease in demand for    maurices    
        products, a change in the competitive environment or other industry and economic
        factors.   During
        the fourth quarter, on or about June 30th, the  
        Company
        did perform an assessment for impairment of our goodwill and our intangible
        assets with indefinite lives. Based on the estimated fair market values
        (calculated using   discounted  
        cash
        flows, comparable transactions, and comparable public companies) of the goodwill
        and our intangible assets with indefinite lives, we determined that no
        impairment exists.

Store
      preopening costs  

Non-capital
      expenditures, such as advertising and payroll costs incurred prior to the
      opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are
      incurred. 

Marketing
      and advertising costs  

Marketing
      and advertising costs are included in selling, general and administrative
      expenses and are expensed   the
      first
      time the advertising campaign takes place  .
      Marketing and advertising expenses were $17.3 million for Fiscal 2006, $15.5
      million for Fiscal 2005, and $12.3 million for Fiscal 2004. 

Operating
      leases  

The
      Company leases retail stores under operating leases. Most lease agreements
      contain construction allowances, and rent escalations. For purposes of
      recognizing incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis
      over
      the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date of initial possession to
      begin amortization, which is generally when the Company enters the space and
      begins to make improvements in preparation of intended use. 

For
      construction allowances, the Company records a deferred rent liability in  Other
      accrued expenses  and  Deferred rent and other  on the consolidated balance
      sheets and amortizes the deferred rent over the term of the respective lease
      as
      reductions to  Cost of sales including occupancy and buying costs  on the
      consolidated statements of earnings. 

For
      scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments
      commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy, the Company
      records minimum rental expenses on a straight-line basis over the terms of
      the
      leases on the consolidated statements of earnings.  

Certain
      leases provide for contingent rents, which are determined as a percentage of
      gross sales in excess of specified levels. The Company records a contingent
      rent
      liability in  Other accrued expenses  on the consolidated balance sheets and the
      corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when
      management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal
      year
      is probable.  

Use
      of estimates   

The
        preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
        us
        to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
        consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The more significant
        items subject to such estimates and assumptions include fair value of our
        equity
        securities, carrying amount of property and equipment,   goodwill,
        other intangible assets,   obligations
        related to employee benefits, inventory valuation, insurance reserves, and
        accounting for income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Comprehensive
      income  

Comprehensive
      income is calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 130,    Reporting
      Comprehensive Income   ,
      and
      includes our net earnings and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
      marketable securities. Cumulative unrealized gains and losses on
      available-for-sale marketable securities are reflected as accumulated other
      comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders  equity.

Share-based
      compensation   

Effective
        July 31, 2005, the Company began recording compensation expense associated
        with
        stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with SFAS
        No.
        123R,    Share-Based
        Payment   ,
        ( SFAS
        No. 123R )   as
        interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.   107,
           Valuation
        of share-based payment arrangements for public companies   ,
        (SAB
        107).  
        Prior to
        July 31, 2005, we had accounted for stock options according to the provisions
        of
        Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 25,    Accounting
        for Stock Issued to Employees   ,
        and
        related interpretations, and therefore no related compensation expense was
        recorded for awards granted with no intrinsic value. We adopted the modified
        prospective transition method provided under SFAS No. 123R, and, consequently,
        have not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods. Under this
        transition method, compensation cost associated with stock options recognized
        in
        the fiscal year ended July 29, 2006 ( Fiscal 2006 ) includes: 1) amortization
        related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted
        prior to July 31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
        accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123; and 2) amortization
        related to all stock option awards granted subsequent to July 31, 2005, based
        on
        the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of
        SFAS
        No. 123R. 

During
        the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006, the Company recognized approximately
        $4.4 million in share-based compensation expense  
        related
        to stock options and approximately $0.6 million in share-based compensation
        expense related to restricted stock  .
        No
        compensation cost was recognized prior to July 31, 2005, other than amortization
        of restricted stock grants. Had compensation cost for our share-based
        compensation plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123,    Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation   ,
          the
        Company s net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
        following pro forma amounts: 

The
      fair
      values of the options granted under the Company s fixed stock option plans were
      estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
      with
      the following assumptions: 

The
      Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the
      fair
      value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
      transferable. The expected life of options represents the period of time the
      options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical trends.
  The
      Company compiled historical data on an employee-by-employee basis from the
      grant
      date through the settlement date. The results showed that there were four
      distinct populations of optionees, the Executives   Officers Group, the
      Outside Directors group, the Store Managers group and the All Others Group.
      The
      expected term for the Store Managers group was computed per the guidance in
      SAB
      107 ( simplified method ) due to a lack of historical data. Thus, the Company
      will use different expected term assumptions for these four groups in estimating
      fair value, as this approach is more precise and yielded a more accurate
      estimate of fair value than using one term assumption for all groups. The
      risk-free rate is based on the yield of a US Treasury strip rate with a maturity
      date corresponding to the expected term of the option granted. The expected
      volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company s
      stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted. All
  option
      valuation models require input of highly subjective assumptions. Because the
      Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different
      from those of traded options, and because changes in subjective input
      assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the actual value
      realized at the time the options are exercised may differ from the estimated
      values computed above. SFAS No. 123R also requires forfeitures to be estimated
      at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
      forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Financial
      instruments  

Concentration
      of Credit Risk - Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company
      to
      concentrations of credit risk, are principally bank deposits and short-term
      investments. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high credit quality
      financial institutions. Short-term investments principally consist of  triple A 
or  double A  rated instruments.

        carrying
        amounts of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts payable
        approximate fair value because of the short-term nature and maturity of such

Recent
      accounting pronouncements  

In
      March
      2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 47 ( FIN 47 ),  Accounting for
      Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement
      No. 143.  FIN 47 clarifies the scope and timing of liability recognition for
      conditional asset retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143 and was effective
      as
      of our 2006 fiscal year end. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material
      impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
      flows.  

In
        May
        2005, the   Financial
        Accounting Standards Board (   FASB )  
        issued
        SFAS No. 154,    Accounting
        Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion     No.
        20 and FASB Statement No. 3   .  
        SFAS No.
        154 provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes
        and error corrections. It establishes retrospective application as the required
        method for reporting a change in accounting principle. SFAS   No.
        154
        provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a
        change
        in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when
        retrospective application is impracticable. SFAS No. 154 also addresses the
        reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial
        statements. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and error
        corrections made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company
        does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material impact
        on   our
        consolidated  
        financial position  ,  
        results
        of operations  
        or cash
        flows  . 

In
        June
        2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force   ( EITF )
          of
        the
        FASB reached a consensus on Issue No. 05-6,    Determining
        the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements   
        ( EITF
        05-6 ). The guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business
        combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized
        over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes
        renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination
        or
        purchase. The guidance was effective for periods beginning after June 29,
        2005.
        The adoption of EITF 05-6 did not have a material effect on the Company s
        consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
        flows. 

In
        October 2005, the   FASB  
        issued
        FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 13-1,    Accounting
        for Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period   ,
        which
        mandates that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases
        incurred during construction shall be recognized as rental expense. The guidance
        is effective as of the first reporting period beginning after December 15,
        2005.
        The adoption of FSP No. FAS 13-1 did not have a material effect on the Company s
        consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
        flows. 

In
        February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,    Accounting
        for Certain Hybrid Instruments, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and
        140   
        ("SFAS
        155"). SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives
        to
        be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to separate the derivative
        from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on
        a
        fair value basis. It also clarifies which interest only strips and principal
        only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement 133; establishes
        a
        requirement to evaluate interest in securitized financial assets to identify
        interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
        instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring separation; clarifies
        that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded
        derivatives; and amends Statement 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
        qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument
        that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
        instrument. SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired
        or
        issued after the beginning of an entity's first fiscal year that begins after
        September 15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 155 is not expected to have
  a
        material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations
        or
        cash flows or   any
        impact on the Company's results of operations or financial
        condition.

In
      June
      2006, the FASB issued  FIN  
      No. 48,
   Accounting
      for Uncertainty in Income Taxes   an interpretation of FASB Statement
      No.     109   ,  
      which
      clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial
      statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,    Accounting
      for Income Taxes   .
      FIN 48
      provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of
      a
      tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 requires
      that
      companies recognize in their consolidated financial statements the impact of
      a
      tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
      based
      on the technical merits of the position. The first step is to evaluate the
      tax
      position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
      indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on
      audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if
      any.
      The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is
      more
      than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides
      guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
      in
      interim periods, disclosures, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
      years beginning after December 15, 2006 (our Fiscal 2008). We have not completed
      our evaluation of the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated
      financial statements.

      Marketable Securities and Investments   

The
        Company purchases short-term investments and marketable securities that have
        been designated as  available-for-sale  as required by SFAS No. 115,
   Accounting
        for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities   .
        Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized
        gains and losses reported in shareholders  equity under the caption
 Accumulated   other
        comprehensive income (loss  ). 
The
        cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification
        method. 

The
      amortized cost and estimated fair value based on published closing prices of
      securities at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005, are shown below. 

Auction
      Rate Securities  

Auction
      rate securities have been classified as short-term marketable securities.
      Auction rate securities are variable rate bonds tied to short-term interest
      rates with maturities on the face of the securities in excess of 90 days.
      Auction rate securities have interest rate resets through a modified Dutch
      auction, at predetermined short-term intervals, usually every 7, 28 or 35 days.
      They trade at par and are callable at par on any interest payment date at the
      option of the issuer. Interest paid during a given period is based upon the
      interest rate determined during the prior auction. Although these securities
      are
      issued and rated as long-term bonds, they are priced and traded as short-term
      instruments because of the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset.
      All of our auction rate securities holdings are tax-exempt. 

The
      cost
      and estimated fair value of our available-for-sale marketable securities and
      investments by stated maturities at July 29, 2006 is as follows: 

The
      Company periodically reviews its investment portfolio to determine if there
      is
      an impairment that is other than temporary, and to date has not experienced
      any
      impairment in its investments that were other than temporary. In evaluating
      whether the individual investments in the investment portfolio are not other
      than temporarily impaired, the Company considered the credit rating of the
      individual securities, the cause of the impairment of the individual securities,
      and the severity of the impairment of the individual securities.

          - 13 

Proceeds
        from the sale of the above investment were $1.9 million, $114.6 million and
        $62.9 million in Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively.
        Gross
        realized losses from the sale of the above investments were $3,000 and $579,000
        in Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively. In Fiscal 2004, gross realized
        gains from the sale of the above investments were $15,000. For the purposes
        of determining gross realized gains and losses, the cost of securities is
        based
        upon specific identification. The realized losses and gains from the sale
        of
        marketable securities are reflected in interest income on our consolidated
        statements of earnings.

      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

In
      January 2005, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Maurices
      Incorporated. The total purchase price was $328.3 million, net of cash acquired,
      which included $4.4 million of transaction fees. The transaction was financed
      by
      $114.3 million in cash (derived from the sale of investments), the issuance
      of
      $115 million 2.5% convertible senior notes due 2024, and $100 million from
      borrowings under a $250 million senior credit facility (consisting of a $100
      million term loan, and a $150 million revolving credit line under which no
      funds
      were drawn). The Company s consolidated financial statements include
   maurices    
results
      of operations from January 2, 2005. The Company accounted for the acquisition
      as
      a purchase using the accounting standards established in SFAS No. 141, Business
      Combinations, and, accordingly, the excess purchase price over the fair market
      value of the underlying net assets acquired, or $132.6 million, was allocated
      to
      goodwill.  

In
      accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, amortization
      of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is replaced with annual
      impairment tests. The Company performs an impairment test at least annually
      on
      or about June 30th or whenever events or changes in business circumstances
      necessitate determining whether an impairment charge related to the carrying
      value of the Company s recorded goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets is
      needed.  

Other
      identifiable intangible assets consist of trade names, customer relationships
      and proprietary technology. Trade names have an indefinite life and therefore
      are not amortized. Customer relationships and proprietary technology constitute
      the Company's identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization, which
      are
      amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. 

Other
        intangible assets were comprised of the following as of July 29,
        2006: 

The
      estimated annual amortization expense over the next five years is $1 million
      per
      fiscal year. The weighted average expected life of the other   intangible
      assets subject to amortization is 6 years.    

The
      following unaudited pro forma information assumes the Maurices Incorporated
      acquisition had occurred on July 27, 2003. The pro forma information, as
      presented below, is not indicative of the results that would have been obtained
      had the transaction occurred on July 27, 2003, nor is it indicative of the
      Company s future results.

      Litigation  

In
      2003,
      after a trial in the Superior Court of Connecticut, Waterbury District, a jury
      returned a verdict of $30 million of compensatory damages against the
      Company.  The court then entered a judgment of approximately $32 million in
      compensatory damages and expenses, which was subject to post-judgment
      interest.  In addition to the original litigation charge of $32 million
      recorded in Fiscal 2003, the Company accrued interest and other amounts of
      approximately $3.3 million in the consolidated statement of earnings in Fiscal
      2004.  In July 2005, the Supreme Court of Connecticut's decision to reverse
      the judgment against the Company became final. Upon the Supreme Court of
      Connecticut's decision reversing the judgment described above, approximately
      $35.3 million of previously recognized litigation charges were reversed in
      the
      consolidated statement of earnings in Fiscal 2005 and amounts held in the escrow
      account established in connection with the Company's appeal were
      released. 

We
      are
      subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business.   Although
      the outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty, in our opinion,
      dispositions of these matters are not expected to have a material adverse affect
      on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

5.
      Long Term Debt  

On
      December 15, 2004, the Company issued 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024
      ( Convertible Senior Notes ). The Convertible Senior Notes have an aggregate
      principal amount of $115 million and interest is payable on June 15 and December
      15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2005, except that from March 15, 2005
      to
      May 2, 2005, the notes bore interest at the rate of 2.75% per year. Beginning
      with the period commencing on December 22, 2011 and ending June 14, 2012, and
      for each of the six-month periods thereafter commencing on June 15, 2012, the
      Company is required to pay contingent interest during the applicable interest
      period if the average trading price of the notes on the five trading days ending
      on the third day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable interest
      period equals or exceeds 120% of the principal amount of the notes. The
      contingent interest payable per note within any applicable interest period
      will
      equal an annual rate of 0.25% of the average trading price of a note during
      the
      measuring period. The Company may redeem some or all of the Convertible Senior
      Notes for cash at any time on or after December 22, 2011 at a redemption price
      equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest.
      Holders may convert their notes into cash and shares of the Company s common
      stock, if any, at a conversion rate of 95.1430 shares per $1,000 principal
      amount of Convertible Senior Notes (equal to a conversion price of approximately
      $10.51 per share), during specified periods, if the price of the Company s
      common stock reaches, or the trading price of the convertible notes falls below,
      specified thresholds, or upon the event of certain Company transactions. As
      of
      July 31, 2006 and continuing through October 27, 2006, the holders of the
      Convertible Senior Notes may convert their notes as described above because
      the
      Company s stock price closed at or above $12.61 per share for twenty trading
      days within the thirty trading day period ending on July 29, 2006. Upon
      conversion, the Company would deliver cash for the aggregate principal amount
      of
      Convertible Senior Notes to be converted. The excess, if any, of the price
      of
      the Company s common stock above $10.51 per share would be payable in common
      shares. Upon certain corporate transactions, the Company may issue additional
      shares based on the date the corporate transaction becomes effective and the
      price of the Company s common stock. If the market price of the common stock
      exceeds the conversion price, the Company is required to use the treasury stock
      method in calculating diluted earnings per share for the number of shares to
      be
      issued for the excess value. On July 29, 2006, the market value of the
      Convertible Senior Notes was $242.1 million as valued on PORTAL (Private
      Offering Resale and Trading through Automated Linkage). 

On
      December 21, 2005, we entered into a credit agreement with several lenders
      (the
 Credit Agreement ) to replace an existing Senior Credit Facility Agreement and
      related Guarantee and Collateral Agreement that were both dated January 3,
      2005.
      The Credit Agreement provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility
      that provides for borrowings and issuance of letters of credit for up to $100
      million. We may also request the senior revolving credit facility be increased
      up to an additional $50 million. Amounts under the revolving credit facility
      may
      be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by the Company from time to time until
      termination. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 21, 2010 or earlier
      under certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on
      either LIBOR or the higher of the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or
      the
      Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. The interest rates under the Credit
      Agreement vary depending upon our adjusted leverage ratio. The interest rate
      varies from 100 basis points to 150 basis points above LIBOR for Eurocurrency
      loans and 0 basis points to 50 basis points above the prime rate or Federal
      Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% for base rate loans. The interest rate varies
      from 20 basis points to 150 basis points above the prime rate for letters of
      credit or Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%. During the term of the Credit
      Agreement, we will pay the lenders a fee, which varies, based upon our adjusted
      leverage ratio from 0.20% to 0.25%, and is equal to the product of such
      percentage per annum and the available portion of the revolving credit
      facility. 

The
      Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants
      customary for facilities of this type, including, among other things, limits
      on
      the incurrence of debt or liens, a limit on the making of dividends or
      distributions, a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest, income
      taxes, depreciation, and amortization, a limit on the ratio of earnings before
      interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization to fixed charges, a
      minimum net worth requirement and a limit on capital expenditures. The Credit
      Agreement contains events of default customary for facilities of this type
      (with
      customary grace periods, as applicable) and provides that, upon the occurrence
      of an event of default, the interest rate on all outstanding obligations will
      be
      increased and payment of all outstanding loans may be accelerated and/or the
      lenders  commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of
      certain insolvency or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts payable
      under the Credit Agreement shall automatically become immediately due and
      payable, and the lenders' commitments will automatically terminate. Pursuant
      to
      a related Collateral Agreement, we pledged certain of our securities to the
      collateral agent as security for the full payment and performance of our
      obligations under the Credit Agreement and granted the collateral agent a
      security interest in substantially all of the Company s property as security for
      the full payment and performance of our obligations under the Credit Agreement.
      None of our subsidiaries has guaranteed the Credit Agreement. As of July 29,
      2006, $37 million was available under the Credit Agreement, which represents
      the
      $100 million from our senior secured revolving credit facility less $63 million
      of outstanding letters of credit at July 29, 2006.

On
      December 14, 2004, the Company entered into a senior credit facility with a
      number of banks ( Senior Credit Facility ). The Senior Credit Facility
      terminated on December 21, 2005 when we entered into the Credit Agreement
      discussed above. The Senior Credit Facility had consisted of a $150 million
      revolving credit facility and a $100 million term loan. As of the date of the
      termination, the Company had repaid the term loan and had not borrowed any
      funds
      under the $150 million revolving credit facility. 

In
        connection with the issuance of the Convertible Senior Notes and the Senior
        Credit Facility, the Company incurred approximately $4.0 million in underwriting
        costs and $4.1 million in professional fees. Such fees were deferred and
        included in  Other assets  on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
        Certain of these amounts were fully amortized to interest expense with the
        repayment of the $100 million term loan and the termination of the Senior
        Credit
        Facility. At July 29, 2006, there  were
        $3.7
        million  of unamortized costs.     

In
      connection with the purchase of the Suffern facility, Dunnigan Realty, LLC
      ( Dunnigan ), in July 2003, borrowed $34 million under a 5.33% rate mortgage
      loan. The Dunnigan mortgage loan (the  Mortgage ) is collateralized by a
      mortgage lien on the Suffern facility, of which the major portion is the
      Company s corporate offices and dressbarn s distribution center. Payments of
      principal and interest on the mortgage, a 20-year fully amortizing loan, are
      due
      monthly through July 2023. In connection with the mortgage, the Company paid
      approximately $1.7 million in debt issuance costs. These costs were deferred
      and
      included in  Other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being
      amortized to interest expense over the life of the Mortgage.  

Long-term
      debt consists of the following: 

Scheduled
      principal payments of the above debt for each of the next five fiscal years
      and
      beyond is as follows: $1.1 million, $1.2 million, $1.3 million, $1.4 million,
      $1.4 million and $139.5 million, respectively. 

Interest
      expense relating to the above debt was approximately $4.6 million for the fiscal
      year ended July 29, 2006, $6.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 30, 2005
      and $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2004. Fees related to the
      Credit Agreement and the Senior Credit Facility totaled $0.4 million for the
      fiscal year ended July 29, 2006 and $0.5 million for the fiscal year ended
      July
      30, 2005.

      Stock Repurchase Program   

The
      Board
      of Directors authorized a $75 million stock repurchase program that was
      announced on April 5, 2001. As of the date of this filing, the Company had
      repurchased 4,885,400 shares at an aggregate purchase price of approximately
      $26.7 million. At July 29, 2006, we had $48.3 million of repurchase availability
      remaining. During Fiscal 2005, 200,000 shares were repurchased under this stock
      repurchase program. Purchases of shares of the Company s common stock will be
      made at the Company s discretion from time to time, subject to market conditions
      and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases or in privately
      negotiated transactions. Treasury (reacquired) shares are retired and treated
      as
      authorized but unissued shares.

      Earnings Per Share  

Basic
      earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of common
      shares outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share assumes the
      exercise of all stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion
      of the Senior Convertible Notes (see Note 5), to the extent dilutive. Diluted
      earnings per share are computed based upon the weighted average number of common
      and common equivalent shares outstanding. Common equivalent shares outstanding
      consist of shares covered by stock options and the Convertible Senior Notes,
      to
      the extent dilutive. All prior period common stock share amounts have been
      adjusted to reflect a two-for-one split of the Company s common stock effective
      April 3, 2006. 

A
      reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares
      outstanding is presented below: 

The
        Convertible Senior Notes were dilutive at July 29, 2006 as the average price
        of
        the Company s stock was more than the conversion price of the Convertible Senior
        Notes, in accordance with   EITF
          Issue
        No.
        04-8,    The
        Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per
        Share   .
        The
        number of additional shares related to the dilutive effect of the Convertible
        Senior Notes was approximately 4,946,000 shares for Fiscal 2006. The Convertible
        Senior Notes did not have a dilutive effect on earnings per share for Fiscal
          2005. 

There
      were no common stock equivalents that were anti-dilutive for Fiscal 2006. Common
      stock equivalents of 52,200 and 4,000 for the fiscal years ended July 30, 2005
      and July 31, 2004, respectively, were excluded because such common stock
      equivalents were anti-dilutive.

      Employee Benefit Plans  

The
      Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement savings plan (401(k))
      covering all eligible employees. The Company also sponsors an Executive
      Retirement Plan for certain officers and key executives. Both plans allow
      participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation and receive a
      matching employer contribution on a portion of that deferral. During Fiscal
      2006, 2005 and 2004 the Company incurred expenses of $2,828,000, $2,171,000,
      and
      $1,815,000, respectively, relating to the contributions to and administration
      of
      the above plans. These expenses are allocated to cost of sales and selling,
      general and administrative expenses in accordance with our accounting policies
      described in Note 1. The Company also sponsors an Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
      which allows employees to purchase shares of Company stock during each quarterly
      offering period at a 10% discount through weekly payroll deductions. The Company
      does not provide any additional postretirement benefits.

      components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: 

Significant
      components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were as
      follows: 

The
      Fiscal 2006 total net deferred tax liability is presented on the balance sheet
      as a current asset of $6.5 million and as a long-term liability of $10.1
      million. The Fiscal 2005 total net deferred tax liability is presented on the
      balance sheet as a current liability of $3.6 million and a long-term liability
      of $7.2 million. The components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax
      liabilities were as follows:

      Commitments and Contingencies  

Lease
      commitments  

The
      Company leases all of its stores. Certain leases provide for additional rents
      based on percentages of net sales, charges for real estate taxes, insurance
      and
      other occupancy costs. Store leases generally have an initial term of
      approximately 10 years with one or more 5-year options to extend the lease.
      Some
      of these leases have provisions for rent escalations during the initial term.
      The Company receives rental income and reimbursement for taxes and common area
      maintenance charges from two tenants that occupy a portion of the Suffern
      facility that are not affiliated with the Company. The rental income from the
      other tenants is shown as  other income  on the Company s Consolidated
      Statements of Earnings.  

A
      summary
      of occupancy costs follows:  

The
      following is a schedule of future minimum rentals under noncancellable operating
      leases as of July 29, 2006,  

        (amounts
      in thousands):  

Although
      the Company has the ability to cancel certain leases if specified sales levels
      are not achieved, future minimum rentals under such leases have been included
      in
      the above table.  

Leases
      with related parties  

The
      Company leases two stores from its Chairman or related trusts. Future minimum
      rentals under leases with such related parties which extend beyond July 29,
      2006, included in the above schedule, are approximately $312,000 annually and
      in
      the aggregate $1.4 million. The leases also contain provisions for cost
      escalations and additional rent based on net sales in excess of stipulated
      amounts. Rent expense for Fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 under these leases
      amounted to approximately $364,000, $335,000 and $308,000,
      respectively.

Contractual
      obligations and commercial commitments  

The
      estimated significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial
      commitments at July 29, 2006 are summarized in the following table:

In
      addition to the commitments represented in the above table, the Company enters
      into a number of cancelable and non-cancelable commitments during the year.
      Typically, these commitments are for less than a year in duration and are
      principally focused on the construction of new retail stores and the procurement
      of inventory. The Company does not maintain any long-term or exclusive
      commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any single supplier.
      Preliminary commitments with the Company's private label merchandise vendors
      typically are made five to seven months in advance of planned receipt date.
      Substantially all of the Company s merchandise purchase commitments are
      cancelable up to 30 days prior to the vendor s scheduled shipment
      date.

      Stock-Based Compensation Plans  

The
      Company's 2001 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of either ISO s or
      non-qualified options to purchase shares of common stock. At the November 30,
      2005 Annual Shareholders Meeting, shareholders approved an additional 6 million
      shares available for issuance (for a total of 12 million) under the 2001 Stock
      Incentive Plan. As of July 29, 2006, there were approximately 7.0 million shares
      under the 2001 plan available for future grant. All of the Company s prior stock
      option plans have expired as to the ability to grant new options. The Company
      issues new shares of common stock when stock option awards are exercised. Refer
      to the c  onsolidated
      statements of shareholders  equity and comprehensive income for new shares of
      common stock issued in Fiscal 2006, Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. 

Stock
      option awards outstanding under the Company s current plans have generally been
      granted at exercise prices which are equal to the market value of our stock
      on
      the date of grant, generally vest over five years and expire no later than
      ten
      years after the grant date. Effective July 31, 2005, we recognize compensation
      expense ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. As of
      July 29, 2006, there was $14.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
      related to nonvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a
      remaining weighted-average vesting period of 3.6 years. The total intrinsic
      value of options exercised during the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006 was
      approximately $15.6 million.  The
      total
      fair value of options that vested during the fifty-two weeks ended July 29,
      2006
      was approximately $3.0 million.     

F
          - 20 

The
      following table summarizes the activities in all Stock Option Plans and changes
      during each of the fiscal years presented: 

The
      aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding at July 29, 2006 was $23.4
      million. The aggregate intrinsic value of options that are exercisable at July
      29, 2006 was $4.2 million.  

The
      following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at July
      29, 2006: 

The
      2001
      Stock Incentive Plan also allows for the issuance of restricted shares. Prior
      to
      January 2005, restricted shares did not count against the 2001 Stock Incentive
      Plan. Effective January 2005, any shares of restricted stock are counted against
      the shares available for future grant limit as three shares for every one
      restricted share granted. In general, if options are canceled for any reason,
      or
      expire or terminate unexpired, the shares covered by such options again become
      available for grant. If a share of restricted stock is forfeited for any reason,
      three shares become available for grant.  

In
      accordance with SFAS No. 123R, the fair value of restricted stock awards is
      estimated on the date of grant based on the market price of our stock and is
      amortized to compensation expense on a graded basis over the related vesting
      periods, which are generally five years. As of July 29, 2006, there was $1.5
      million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted
      stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining
      weighted-average vesting period of 3.2 years. The unrecognized compensation
      cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards was recorded as unearned
      compensation in shareholders  equity at July 30, 2005. As part of the adoption
      of SFAS No. 123R, the unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested
      restricted stock awards granted prior to July 31, 2005 was included as a
      component of additional paid-in capital. The total fair value of the restricted
      stock awards recognized as compensation expense during the fifty-two weeks
      ended
      July 29, 2006 was $641,000. Compensation expense recognized for restricted
      stock
      awards during the fifty-two weeks ended July 30, 2005 was $398,000.   The
      Company recognized $67,000 of compensation expense in Fiscal 2004  . 

F
          - 21 

Following
      is a summary of the changes in the shares of restricted stock outstanding during
      the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006: 

The
      Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible full-time employees to
      purchase a limited number of shares of the Company s common stock during each
      quarterly offering period at a 10% discount through weekly payroll deductions.
      During the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006, we sold approximately 15,000
      shares to employees at an average discount of $1.93 per share under the Employee
      Stock Purchase Plan. The compensation expense recognized for the discount given
      under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was approximately $29,000 for the
      fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006. 

Prior
      to
      the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we presented all tax benefits resulting from
      the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated
      Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires that cash flows resulting
      from tax deductions in excess of the cumulative compensation cost recognized
      for
      options exercised ( excess tax benefits ) be classified as financing cash flows.
      For the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2006, excess tax benefits realized from
      the exercise of stock options was $1.9 million.

  Segments    

Our
      reportable segments are the    dressbarn   
      brands,
      which are used in   575
      Combo
      stores (a combination of    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman

      stores  
      in 45
      states as of July 29, 2006 and the    maurices   
      brand,
      which is used in 546 stores in 40 states as of July 29, 2006. The Company
      completed the acquisition of Maurices Incorporated in January 2005. 

The
      Company s    dressbarn   
      stores
      are operated mostly in a combination of    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores,
      or Combo stores, which carry    dressbarn   
      and
      larger-sized    dressbarn       woman   
      merchandise, as well as freestanding    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores.
      The    dressbarn   
      brands
      primarily attract female consumers in the mid 30 s to mid 50 s age range, while
   maurices    
      fashions are designed to appeal to the 17 to 34 year-old-female as well as
      the
      causal apparel needs of the 17 to 34 year-old-male  .
      Our
   maurices   
      stores
      are concentrated in small markets in the United States, while our    dressbarn   
      and
   dressbarn       woman   
      stores
      tend to be in larger population markets.   Substantially
      all of    maurices    
      management team prior to the acquisition continues to manage the daily
      operations of    maurices   .
         maurices   
      also
      distributes goods to its stores through a separate distribution center.
   maurices   
      also has
      separate financial reporting systems from    dressbarn   .
      We
      believe that    maurices   
      is
      currently a reportable segment due to management s review of    maurices    
      separately available operating results and other financial information to
      regularly assess its performance for decision-making purposes.

                process, summarize and report financial information;
                and
