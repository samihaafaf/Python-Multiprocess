ITEM
                I.  

BUSINESS   

(All
      dollar amounts in this report are in thousands, except per square foot
      data). 

GENERAL   

Village
      Super Market, Inc. (the  Company ), founded in 1937, operates a chain of
      twenty-three ShopRite supermarkets, sixteen of which are located in northern
      New
      Jersey, one in northeastern Pennsylvania and six in the southern shore area
      of
      New Jersey. The Company is a member of Wakefern Food Corporation ("Wakefern"),
      the nation's largest retailer-owned food cooperative and owner of the ShopRite
      name. This relationship provides the Company many of the economies of scale
      in
      purchasing, distribution, advanced retail technology and advertising associated
      with chains of greater size and geographic coverage. 

The
      Company seeks to generate high sales volume by offering a wide variety of high
      quality products at consistently low prices. During fiscal 2006, sales per
      store
      were $44,209 and sales per selling square foot was $1,008. The Company gives
      continuing attention to the d cor and format of its stores and tailors each
      store's product mix to the preferences of the local community. The Company
      concentrates on the development of superstores. On October 27, 2004, the Company
      opened an 80,000 square foot store in Somers Point, New Jersey to replace a
      smaller store. Below is a summary of the range of store sizes at July 29,
      2006: 

These
      larger store sizes enable the Company s superstores to provide a  one-stop 
shopping experience and to feature expanded higher margin specialty departments
      such as home meal replacement, an on-site bakery, an expanded delicatessen
      including prepared foods, a variety of natural and organic foods, ethnic and
      international foods and a fresh seafood section. Superstores also offer an
      expanded selection of non-food items such as cut flowers, health and beauty
      aids, greeting cards, small appliances, photo processing and in most cases,
      a
      pharmacy. Recently remodeled and new superstores emphasize a Power Alley, which
      features high margin, fresh convenience offerings such as salad bars, bakery
      and
      Bistro Street home meal replacement in an area within the store that provides
      quick customer entry and exit for those customers shopping for today's lunch
      or
      dinner. The following table shows the percentage of the Company's sales
      allocable to various product categories during each of the periods indicated,
      as
      well as the number of superstores and percentage of selling square feet
      allocable to these stores during each of these periods: 

3 

A
      variety
      of factors affect the profitability of each of the Company's stores, including
      local competitors, size, access and parking, lease terms, management
      supervision, and the strength of the ShopRite trademark in the local community.
      The Company continually evaluates individual stores to determine if they should
      be closed. A stand-alone drug store near the Bernardsville store closed in
      fiscal 2005 when the Bernardsville store was expanded to include a pharmacy.
      The
      Company s only liquor store closed on July 30, 2005. 

DEVELOPMENT
      AND EXPANSION   

The
      Company has an ongoing program to upgrade and expand its supermarket chain.
      This
      program has included major store remodelings as well as the opening or
      acquisition of additional stores. When remodeling, the Company has sought,
      whenever possible, to increase the amount of selling space in its
      stores. 

In
      fiscal
      2006, the Company completed the expansion and remodel of the Springfield store,
      began a major remodel of the Rio Grande store, and completed smaller remodels
      of
      the Elizabeth and Chester stores. 

In
      fiscal
      2005, the Company opened an 80,000 square foot replacement store in Somers
      Point, completed the Bernardsville expansion and remodel, and began the
      expansion and remodel of the Springfield store. 

4 

In
      fiscal
      2004, the Company began the expansion and remodel of the Bernardsville store
      and
      the construction of the replacement store in Somers Point. In fiscal 2003,
      the
      Company remodeled the English Creek, Hillsborough and Rio Grande stores. In
      fiscal 2002, the Company opened a 64,000 sq. ft. store in Hammonton and a 59,000
      sq. ft. store in Garwood. In fiscal 2001, the Company opened a 67,000 sq. ft.
      store in West Orange to replace an older, smaller store.  

The
      Company has budgeted approximately $14 million for capital expenditures in
      fiscal 2007. Planned expenditures include the completion of the Rio Grande
      remodel and construction of an anticipated new store in Franklin, New Jersey.

Delays
      associated with governmental regulations, and the general difficulty in
      developing retail properties in the Company's primary trading area, have
      prevented the Company from opening the desired number of new stores. Additional
      store remodelings and sites for new stores are in various stages of development.
      The Company will also consider additional acquisitions should appropriate
      opportunities arise. 

WAKEFERN
      FOOD CORPORATION   

The
      Company is the second largest member of Wakefern and owns 15.9% of Wakefern s
      outstanding stock as of July 29, 2006. Wakefern, which was organized in 1946,
      is
      the nation s largest retailer-owned food cooperative. Wakefern and its forty-two
      shareholder members operate 223 supermarkets and other retail formats, including
      fifty-five stores operated by Wakefern. Only Wakefern and its members are
      entitled to use the ShopRite name and trademark, and to participate in ShopRite
      advertising and promotional programs.  

The
      principal benefits to the Company from its relationship with Wakefern are the
      use of the ShopRite name and trademark, volume purchasing, ShopRite private
      label products, distribution and warehousing economies of scale, ShopRite
      advertising and promotional programs, including the ShopRite Price Plus card
      and
      a co-branded credit card, and the development of advanced retail technology.
      The
      Company believes that the ShopRite name is widely recognized by its customers
      and is a factor in their decisions about where to shop. ShopRite private label
      products accounted for approximately 12% of sales in fiscal 2006. 

Wakefern
      distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each of its stockholders a share of
      its
      earnings in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by the stockholder
      from
      Wakefern during each fiscal year. 

While
      Wakefern has a substantial professional staff, it operates as a member owned
      cooperative. Executives of most members make contributions of time to the
      business of Wakefern. Senior executives of the Company spend a significant
      amount of their time working on various Wakefern committees, which oversee
      and
      direct Wakefern purchases and other programs. James Sumas, the Company s Chief
      Executive Officer, is Vice Chairman of Wakefern, and a member of the Wakefern
      Board of Directors. 

5 

Most
      of
      the Company's advertising is developed and placed by Wakefern's professional
      advertising staff. Wakefern is responsible for all television, radio and major
      newspaper advertisements. Wakefern bills its members using various formulas
      which allocate advertising costs in accordance with the estimated proportional
      benefits to each member from such advertising. The Company also places Wakefern
      developed materials with local newspapers. In addition, Wakefern and its
      affiliates provide the Company with other services including liability and
      property insurance, supplies, equipment purchasing, coupon processing, certain
      financial accounting applications, and retail technology support. 

Wakefern
      operates warehouses and distribution facilities in Elizabeth, Woodbridge and
      South Brunswick, New Jersey and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. The Company and
      all
      other members of Wakefern are parties to the Wakefern Stockholder s Agreement
      which provides for certain commitments by, and restrictions on, all shareholders
      of Wakefern. This agreement extends until ten years from the date that
      stockholders representing 75% of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those
      stockholders request the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be terminated. Each
      member is obligated to purchase from Wakefern a minimum of 85% of its
      requirements for products offered by Wakefern. If this purchase obligation
      is
      not met, the member is required to pay Wakefern's profit contribution shortfall
      attributable to this failure. The Company fulfilled this obligation in fiscal
      2006, 2005 and 2004. This agreement also requires that in the event of
      unapproved changes in control of the Company or a sale of the Company or of
      individual Company stores, except to a qualified successor, the Company in
      such
      cases must pay Wakefern an amount equal to the annual profit contribution
      shortfall attributable to the sale of store or change in control. No payments
      are required if the volume lost by a shareholder as a result of the sale of
      a
      store is replaced by such shareholder by increased volume in existing or in
      new
      stores. A "qualified successor" must be, or agree to become, a member of
      Wakefern, and may not own or operate any supermarkets, other than ShopRite
      supermarkets, in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
      Maryland, Virginia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New
      Hampshire, Maine or the District of Columbia or own or operate more than
      twenty-five non-ShopRite supermarkets in any other locations in the United
      States. 

Wakefern,
      under circumstances specified in its bylaws, may refuse to sell merchandise
      to,
      and may repurchase the Wakefern stock of, any member. Such circumstances include
      certain unapproved transfers by a member of its supermarket business or its
      capital stock in Wakefern, unapproved acquisition by a member of certain
      supermarket or grocery wholesale supply businesses, the material breach by
      a
      member of any provision of the bylaws of Wakefern or any agreement with
      Wakefern, or a determination by Wakefern that the continued supplying of
      merchandise or services to such member would adversely affect
      Wakefern. 

Any
      material change in Wakefern's method of operation or a termination or material
      modification of the Company's relationship with Wakefern following termination
      of the above agreements, or otherwise, might have an adverse impact on the
      conduct of the Company's business and could involve additional expense for
      the
      Company. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its obligations under
      these agreements or a member's insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could
      result in increased costs to remaining members.  

6 

Wakefern
      does not prescribe geographical franchise areas to its members. The specific
      locations at which the Company, other members of Wakefern, or Wakefern itself,
      may open new units under the ShopRite name are, however, subject to the approval
      of Wakefern's Site Development Committee. This committee is composed of persons
      who are not employees or members of Wakefern. Committee decisions to deny a
      site
      application may be appealed to the Wakefern Board of Directors. Wakefern assists
      its members in their site selection by providing appropriate demographic data,
      volume projections and estimates of the impact of the proposed store on existing
      member supermarkets in the area. 

Each
      of
      Wakefern's members is required to make capital contributions to Wakefern based
      on the number of stores operated by that member and the purchases generated
      by
      those stores. As additional stores are opened or acquired by a member,
      additional capital must be contributed by it to Wakefern. The Company s
      investment in Wakefern and affiliates was $15,670 at July 29, 2006. The total
      amount of debt outstanding from all capital pledges to Wakefern is $798 at
      July
      29, 2006. The maximum per store capital contribution increased from $650 to
      $675
      on September 21, 2006, resulting in an additional $550 capital pledge due in
      fiscal 2007.  

As
      required by the Wakefern bylaws, the Company s investment in Wakefern is pledged
      to Wakefern to secure the Company s obligation to Wakefern. In addition, five
      members of the Sumas family have guaranteed the Company s obligations to
      Wakefern. These personal guarantees are required of any 5% shareholder of the
      Company who is active in the operation of the Company. Wakefern does not own
      any
      securities of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company s investment in
      Wakefern entitles the Company to enough votes to elect one member to the
      Wakefern Board of Directors due to cumulative voting rights. 

TECHNOLOGY   

The
      Company considers automation and information technology important to its
      operations and competitive position. All stores utilize IBM 4690 point of sale
      systems. Electronic payment options are offered at all checkout locations.
      A
      frame relay communication network is used for reliable, high speed processing
      of
      electronic payments and transmission of data. 

The
      Company s commitment to advanced point of sale and communication systems enables
      it to participate in Price Plus, ShopRite s preferred customer program.
      Customers receive electronic discounts by presenting a scannable Price Plus
      card. This technology also enables the Company to offer continuity programs
      and
      focus on target marketing initiatives. 

The
      Company began installing self-checkout systems in fiscal 2002. Currently, eleven
      stores use these systems to provide improved customer service, especially during
      peak periods, and reduce operating costs. Additional locations are planned
      for
      fiscal 2007. In October 2006, we installed RFID readers in all checkout lanes
      to
      enable contactless payment options for customers to quicken checkout times.

7 

The
      Company utilizes IBM RS/6000 computers in each store as an in-store processor
      to, among other things, replenish inventory. The Company utilizes a computer
      generated ordering system, which is designed to reduce inventory levels and
      out
      of stock conditions, enhance shelf space utilization, and reduce labor costs.
      The Company utilizes a direct store delivery system, consisting of personal
      computers and hand held scanners, for product not purchased through Wakefern
      to
      provide equivalent cost and retail price control over these
      products. 

The
      Company has installed computer based training systems in all stores to assist
      in
      the training of all new cashiers, produce and bakery associates. The Company
      replaced the time and attendance system and labor scheduling system in fiscal
      2006 to improve reporting, work flow and system interfaces, and reduce
      labor. 

The
      Company utilizes digital surveillance systems, which are integrated with the
      cashier monitoring systems, in all stores to aid shrink reduction, increase
      productivity and assist in accident investigations.  

Certain
      in-store department records are computerized, including the records of all
      pharmacy departments. In all stores, meat, seafood, delicatessen, and bakery
      prices are maintained on computer for automatic weighing and pricing. The
      Company seeks to design its stores to use energy efficiently, including
      recycling waste heat generated by refrigeration equipment for heating and other
      purposes. Most stores utilize computerized energy management
      systems. 

The
      Company utilizes a division of Wakefern for data processing services, including
      financial accounting support. 

Wakefern
      and the Company have responded to customers increased use of the internet by
      creating shoprite.com to provide weekly advertising and other shopping
      information. In addition, on-line shopping is available in three store locations
      with store pick-up and delivery options. 

COMPETITION   

The
      supermarket industry is highly competitive. The Company competes directly with
      multiple retail formats, including national, regional and local supermarket
      chains as well as warehouse clubs, supercenters, drug stores, discount general
      merchandise stores, fast food chains, dollar stores and convenience stores.
      The
      Company competes by using low pricing, courteous and quick service to the
      customer, and a broad range of consistently available quality products,
      including ShopRite private labeled products. The ShopRite Price Plus card and
      the co-branded ShopRite credit card also strengthen customer loyalty.

The
      Company's principal competitors include Pathmark, A P, Stop   Shop,
      Acme, Kings, Walmart and Foodtown. Many of the Company's competitors have
      financial resources substantially greater than those of the Company, and some
      are non-union.  

8 

LABOR   

As
      of
      October 13, 2006, the Company employed approximately 4,400 persons of whom
      approximately 68% worked part-time. Approximately 90% of the Company s employees
      are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A contract with one union
      representing employees in six stores will expire in October 2006. Contracts
      with
      the Company s other five unions expire between June 2007 and August 2010. Most
      of the Company s competitors in New Jersey are similarly unionized. 

AVAILABLE
      INFORMATION   

As
      a
      member of the Wakefern cooperative, the Company relies upon our customer focused
      website,    www.shoprite.com   ,
      for
      interaction with customers and prospective employees. This website is maintained
      by Wakefern for the benefit of all ShopRite supermarkets, and therefore, does
      not contain any financial information related to the Company. 

The
      Company will provide paper copies of the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
      reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and press releases free of
      charge upon request to any shareholder. In addition, electronic copies of these
      filings can be obtained at www.sec.gov. 

REGULATORY
      ENVIRONMENT   

The
      Company s business requires various licenses and the registration of facilities
      with state and federal health and drug regulatory agencies. These licenses
      and
      registration requirements obligate the Company to observe certain rules and
      regulations, and a violation of these rules and regulations could result in
      a
      suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations. In addition, most
      licenses require periodic renewals. The Company has not experienced material
      difficulties with respect to obtaining or retaining licenses and registrations.
      In addition, the Company is subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley
      Act of 2002. 

ITEM
                1A.  

RISK
                FACTORS   

COMPETITIVE
      ENVIRONMENT   

        The
      supermarket business is highly competitive and is characterized by narrow profit
      margins. Results of operations therefore may be materially adversely impacted
      by
      competitive pricing and promotional programs and competitor store openings.
      We
      compete with national and regional supermarkets, local supermarkets, warehouse
      club stores, supercenters, drug stores, convenience stores, dollar stores,
      discount merchandisers and other local retailers in the market areas we serve.
      Competition with these outlets is based on price, store location, promotion,
      product assortment, quality and service. Some of these competitors may have
      greater financial resources, lower merchandise acquisition cost and lower
      operating expenses than we do.  

9 

GEOGRAPHIC
      CONCENTRATION   

The
      Company s stores are concentrated in New Jersey, with one store in eastern
      Pennsylvania. We are vulnerable to economic downturns in New Jersey in addition
      to those that may affect the country as a whole. Economic conditions such as
      interest rates, energy costs and unemployment rates may adversely affect our
      sales. Further, since we are concentrated in densely populated metropolitan
      areas, opportunities for future store expansion may be limited, which may
      adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

WAKEFERN
      RELATIONSHIP   

The
      Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. In
      addition, Wakefern provides the Company with support services in numerous areas
      including supplies, advertising, liability and property insurance, technology
      support and other store services. Further, the Company receives patronage
      dividends and other product incentives from Wakefern.  

Any
      material change in Wakefern s method of operation or a termination or material
      modification of the Company s relationship with Wakefern could have an adverse
      impact on the conduct of the Company s business and could involve additional
      expense for the Company. The failure of any Wakefern member to fulfill its
      obligations or a member s insolvency or withdrawal from Wakefern could result in
      increased costs to the Company. Additionally, an adverse change in Wakefern s
      results of operations could have an adverse affect on the Company s results of
      operations.  

LABOR
      RELATIONS   

A
      significant majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
      agreements with unions, and our relationship with those unions, including any
      work stoppages, could have an adverse impact on our financial
      results. 

In
      future
      negotiations with labor unions, we expect that rising health care and pension
      costs, among other issues, will continue to be important topics for negotiation.
      Upon the expiration of our collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages
      by
      the affected workers could occur if we are unable to negotiate acceptable
      contracts with labor unions. This could significantly disrupt our operations.
      Further, if we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided
      for
      in the collective bargaining agreement, we may experience increased operating
      costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations. 

FOOD
      SAFETY   

The
      Company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety
      and quality of the food supply chain. Adverse publicity about these types of
      concerns, whether or not valid, could discourage consumers from buying our
      products. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could
      result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims, which
      could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 

10 

MULTI-EMPLOYER
      PENSION PLANS   

The
      Company is required to make contributions to multi-employer pension plans in
      amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense
      for
      these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits generally are
      based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Based on the most recent
      information available to us, we believe a number of these multi-employer plans
      are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may
      increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues
      in
      the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law,
      an
      employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension
      plan may incur withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion
      of
      the plan s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very
      complex actuarial and allocation rules. The amount of any increase or decrease
      in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend
      upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage
      the plans, government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the
      plans, among other factors.

ITEM

PROPERTIES   

The
      Company owns the sites of five of its supermarkets (containing 335,000 square
      feet of total space), all of which are freestanding stores, except the Egg
      Harbor store, which is part of a shopping center. The remaining eighteen
      supermarkets (containing 937,000 square feet of total space) and the corporate
      headquarters are leased, with initial lease terms generally ranging from twenty
      to thirty years, usually with renewal options. Ten of these leased stores are
      located in shopping centers and the remaining eight are freestanding
      stores. 

The
      annual rent, including capitalized leases, for all of the Company's leased
      facilities for the year ended July 29, 2006 was approximately
      $9,728. 

The
      Company is a limited partner in a real estate partnership that sold its only
      asset and distributed the proceeds to the partners in fiscal 2005. The Company
      received proceeds of $3,096 and recorded income from the partnership of $1,509,
      which is the excess of the proceeds above the Company s investment in the
      partnership and certain receivables due from the partnership. In addition,
      the
      Company is a limited partner in two other partnerships, one of which owns a
      small shopping center in which one of the Company's leased supermarkets is
      located. The Company is also a general partner in a partnership that is a lessor
      of one of the Company's freestanding supermarkets.

As
      required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an
      evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
      disclosure controls and procedures at the end of the period. This evaluation
      was
      carried out under the supervision, and with the participation, of the Company s
      management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer along with the
      Company s Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s
      Chief Executive Officer, along with the Company s Chief Financial Officer,
      concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
      There have been no significant changes in internal controls over financial
      reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. 

Disclosure
      controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed
      to
      ensure that information required to be disclosed in Company reports filed or
      submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
      reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange

      without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
      required to be disclosed in Company reports filed under the Exchange Act is
      accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief
      Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely
      decisions regarding required disclosure.

DEAR
        FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS  

We
        are
        pleased to report that Village exceeded the billion dollar sales milestone
        for
        the first time in fiscal 2006. Sales increased 3.4% to $1,016,817,000. Same
        store sales increased 3.3%. Same store sales have increased 37 consecutive
        quarters. Village also achieved record net income of $16.5 million, a 13%
        increase from the prior year (excluding a non-operating income item in the
        prior
        year). 

The
        Board
        of Directors increased the dividend three times in fiscal 2006. The annualized
        dividends are currently $1.12 per Class A share and $.728 per Class B share.
        These dividend levels are 75% higher than one year ago. Share price appreciation
        and dividends produced a total return for Class A shareholders of 21% in
        fiscal
        2006. 

Village
        generated $35.5 million of operating cash flow in fiscal 2006. We used $14.3
        million to improve our stores, retired $6.8 million of debt and paid dividends
        of $3.0 million. At July 29, 2006, Village had $74.7 million of cash and
        equivalents compared with long-term debt of $27.1 million. This strong financial
        position provides us the flexibility to pursue opportunities that may become
        available as the supermarket industry continues to consolidate. 

During
        fiscal 2006, we completed the expansion and remodel of the Springfield store,
        as
        well as smaller remodels of the Elizabeth and Chester stores. The Rio Grande
        store is currently being substantially remodeled. Our expansions and remodels
        continue to emphasize our successful Power Alley concept, featuring broad
        assortments of fresh, convenient products. We continue to increase our focus
        in
        all stores on the healthy, natural and organic food alternatives our customers
        increasingly desire through the "Live Right with Shop Rite"
        program. 

Village
        plans $14 million of capital expenditures in fiscal 2007. In addition to
        completing the Rio Grande remodel, we expect to begin the construction of
        a new
        superstore in Franklin, New Jersey scheduled to open in early fiscal 2008.
        An
        additional superstore and a replacement store are in the governmental approval
        process. We plan to open these two stores in fiscal 2008 or 2009. 

We
        recently partnered with a local hospital to open a health clinic, "HealthRite",
        in one store as part of our continuing effort to provide customers with a
        one-stop shopping experience. Customers can seek routine medical care and
        fulfill their prescription needs at the same time. In addition, we are
        installing automated external defibrillators (AED's) in all stores this
        month. 

We
        are
        pleased with Village's performance in 2006, but we recognize more challenges
        lie
        ahead. Competition among our traditional supermarket competitors remains
        strong
        and we face potential new competition from supercenters, as well as the
        potential impacts of industry consolidation. Our customers continue to feel
        the
        effect of high gas prices. 

Our
        priorities remain offering high quality products at consistently low prices,
        providing outstanding customer service, creating unique marketing initiatives,
        and expanding and updating our store base. Village's success is due to the
        diligent effort and creative focus of our associates in using our local
        knowledge to focus on the evolving needs of our customers. We thank our
        associates for their efforts and our customers and shareholders for their
        continued support.

        of the economies of scale in purchasing, distribution, advanced retail
        technology and advertising associated with larger chains. 

The
        Company's stores, five of which are owned, average 55,000 total square feet.
        Larger store sizes enable the Company to offer the specialty departments
        that
        customers desire for one-stop shopping, including pharmacies, natural and
        organic departments, ethnic and international foods, and home meal replacement.
        On October 27, 2004, the Company opened an 80,000 sq. ft. store in Somers
        Point,
        New Jersey to replace a smaller store. During fiscal 2006, sales per store
        was
        $44,209 and sales per square foot of selling space was $1,008. Management
        believes these are among the highest in the supermarket industry. 

We
        consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance, such as same
        store
        sales; sales per store; percentage of total sales by department (mix); shrink;
        departmental gross profit percentage; sales per labor hour; and hourly labor
        rates. In recent years, the Company, as well as many of our competitors,
        has
        faced substantial increases in employee health and pension costs and in rates
        charged by various utilities for electricity and gas. These trends are expected
        to continue in fiscal 2007. 

The
        Company utilizes a 52 - 53 week fiscal year, ending on the last Saturday
        in the
        month of July. Fiscal 2004 contains 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2005 contain
        52
        weeks.  

RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS   

The
        following table sets forth the major components of the Consolidated Statements
        of Operations of the Company as a percentage of sales: 

SALES   

          Sales
        were $1,016,817 in fiscal 2006, an increase of $33,138, or 3.4% from the
        prior
        year. Same store sales increased 3.3%. Improved sales in the recently remodeled
        Springfield and Bernardsville stores and the replacement store in Somers
        Point,
        and higher sales in one store due to the closing of a competitor's store
        contributed to the same store sales increase. These improvements were partially
        offset by reduced sales in one store due to a competitive store opening.
        New
        stores and replacement stores are included in same store sales in the quarter
        after the store has been in operation for four full quarters. Store renovations
        are included in same store sales immediately. The Somers Point replacement
        store, which opened October 27, 2004, was included in same store sales beginning
        in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. 

Sales
        were $983,679 in fiscal 2005, an increase of $26,032, or 2.7% from the prior
        year. The prior year included $17,301 of sales from a 53rd week. Excluding
        the
        53rd week from the prior year, sales increased 4.6% in fiscal 2005. Sales
        increased due to the opening of the Somers Point replacement store and a
        4.2%
        increase in same store sales (excluding the 53rd sales week in the prior
        year),
        partially offset by the closing of a stand-alone drugstore. Same store sales
        increased due to higher sales in the recently remodeled Bernardsville store,
        continued improvement in stores opened and remodeled in recent fiscal years,
        higher sales in one store due to the closing of a competitor and increases
        in
        retail prices in certain categories resulting from inflation. These same
        store
        sales improvements were partially offset by reduced sales in three stores
        due to
        competitive openings.  

GROSS
        PROFIT  

          Gross
        profit as a percentage of sales increased .42% in fiscal 2006 compared to
        the
        prior year principally due to higher gross margins in most departments (.33%)
        and improved product mix (.07%). 

Gross
        profit as a percentage of sales increased .57% in fiscal 2005 compared to
        the
        prior year due to higher gross margins in most departments (.43%), improved
        product mix (.15%), reduced LIFO charges (.11%) and reduced warehousing and
        related charges from Wakefern (.10%). These improvements were partially offset
        by increased promotional spending (.13%).

OPERATING
        AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE   

          Operating
        and administrative expense increased by .24% as a percentage of sales in
        fiscal
        2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased fringe benefit
        costs
        (.22%), utility costs (.08%), repair and maintenance costs (.07%) and amounts
        accrued related to a non-income tax audit (.05%). These increases were partially
        offset by lower advertising costs (.06%) and the prior year containing a
        charge
        for future lease obligations for a closed stand-alone drug store (.06%).
        Fringe
        benefits costs increased primarily due to increased expense for employee
        pension
        and medical plans and compensation costs recognized under share-based
        compensation plans. Utility costs increased due to increases in energy prices.
        Both of these trends are expected to continue in fiscal 2007. 

Operating
        and administrative expense increased by .31% as a percentage of sales in
        fiscal
        2005 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased fringe benefit
        costs
        (.15%), supply costs (.09%), utility costs (.06%) and a charge for future
        lease
        obligations for the closed stand-alone drugstore (.06%). Fringe benefit costs
        increased primarily due to increased expense for employee health and pension
        plans and compensation costs recognized under share-based compensation plans.
        Utility and supply costs increased due to increases in energy
        prices. 

DEPRECIATION
        AND AMORTIZATION   

          Depreciation
        and amortization expense was $11,679, $10,595 and $9,495 in fiscal 2006,
        2005
        and 2004, respectively. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in
        fiscal 2006 due to depreciation on fixed asset additions. 

Depreciation
        and amortization expense increased in fiscal 2005 due to depreciation on
        the
        fixed asset additions related to the expansion and remodel of the Bernardsville
        and the Somers Point replacement store. In addition, depreciation expense
        in
        fiscal 2005 included $137 due to adjustments to the depreciable lives of
        certain
        leasehold improvements.  

INCOME
        FROM PARTNERSHIPS  

          The
        Company is a limited partner in a real estate partnership that sold its only
        asset and distributed the proceeds to the partners in fiscal 2005. The Company
        received proceeds of $3,096 and recorded income from the partnership of $1,509,
        which is the excess of the proceeds above the Company's investment in the
        partnership and certain receivables due from the partnership. 

INTEREST
        EXPENSE   

          Interest
        expense, net of interest income, was $1,005, $2,199 and $2,192 in fiscal
        2006,
        2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest expense, net, declined in fiscal 2006
        primarily due to increased interest income from both higher rates received
        on
        excess cash invested at Wakefern and increased amounts invested. The impact
        of
        higher interest rates on variable rate debt outstanding in fiscal 2006 was
        offset by reductions in debt outstanding. 

An
        increase in interest expense of $909 in fiscal 2005 due to the Somers Point
        replacement store capital lease was offset by a decrease in interest expense
        due
        to reductions in notes payable balances in fiscal 2005 and increased interest
        income from higher rates received on excess cash invested at
        Wakefern. 

INCOME
        TAXES   

          The
        Company's effective income tax rate was 41.8%, 41.5% and 41.7% in fiscal
        2006,
        2005 and 2004, respectively. The effective income tax rate increased slightly
        in
        fiscal 2006 as a result of an increase in state income tax rates. Included
        in
        the Company's current tax provision in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004 is $1,087,
        $1,052 and $1,052, respectively, related to the benefit of a tax planning
        strategy which has not been recognized for financial reporting purposes.
        In the
        event these tax matters are resolved in the Company's favor in future years,
        the
        effective tax rate in that fiscal year would be lower. 

CRITICAL
        ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

          Critical
        accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes
        are
        important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results
        of
        operations. These policies require management's most difficult, subjective
        or
        complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about
        the
        effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 

The
        preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
        accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
        that
        affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
        contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
        and
        the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
        Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

IMPAIRMENT  

          The
        Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets, such as property,
        equipment and fixtures and intangibles subject to amortization, for possible
        impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
        carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Such review analyzes the
        undiscounted estimated future cash flows from asset groups at the store level
        to
        determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their
        respective cash flows. If an impairment is indicated, it is measured by
        comparing the discounted cash flows for the long-lived asset groups held
        for use
        to their carrying value. 

Goodwill
        is tested for impairment at the end of each fiscal year, or as circumstances
        dictate. Since the Company's stock is not widely traded, management utilizes
        valuation techniques such as earnings multiples to assess goodwill for
        impairment. Calculating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use
        of
        estimates. Management believes the fair value of the Company's one reporting
        unit exceeds its carrying value at July 29, 2006. Should the Company's carrying
        value of its one reporting unit exceed its fair value, the amount of any
        resulting goodwill impairment may be material to the Company's financial
        position and results of operations.  

PATRONAGE
        DIVIDENDS   

          As
        a
        stockholder of Wakefern, the Company earns a share of Wakefern's earnings,
        which
        is distributed as a "patronage dividend" (see Note 3). This dividend is based
        on
        a distribution of Wakefern's operating profits for its fiscal year (which
        ends
        September 30) in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by each member
        from Wakefern during that fiscal year. Patronage dividends are recorded as
        a
        reduction of cost of sales as merchandise is sold. The Company accrues estimated
        patronage dividends due from Wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the
        annual Wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of the Company's share
        of
        this annual dividend based on the Company's estimated proportional share
        of the
        dollar volume of business transacted with Wakefern that year. The amount
        of
        patronage dividends receivable based on these estimates were $5,740 and $5,470
        at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005, respectively.

MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  

         CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued) 

PENSION
        PLANS  

          The
        determination of the Company's obligation and expense for Company-sponsored
        pension plans is dependent, in part, on the Company's selection of assumptions
        used by actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions are described
        in Note 8 and include, among others, the discount rate, the expected long-term
        rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs.
        In
        accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results
        that
        differ from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over
        future
        periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and recorded
        obligations in future periods. While management believes that its assumptions
        are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant
        changes in the Company's assumptions may materially effect pension obligations
        and future expense. 

The
        objective of the discount rate assumption was to reflect the rate at which
        the
        Company's pension obligations could be effectively settled based on the expected
        timing and amounts of benefits payable to participants under the plans. Based
        on
        these criteria, the Company based the discount rate assumption on published
        indices of investment yields on high-quality fixed-income investments. The
        Company increased the discount rate to 6.25% at July 29, 2006 compared to
        5.5%
        at July 30, 2005. The 75 basis point increase in the discount rate reduced
        the
        projected benefit obligation at July 29, 2006 by a total of $3,467. In fiscal
        2007, the Company expects pension expense to decrease to $3,100 as a result
        of
        this change. The Company evaluated the expected long-term rate of return
        on plan
        assets of 7.5% and the expected increase in compensation costs of 4 to 4.5%
        and
        concluded no changes in these assumptions were necessary in estimating pension
        plan obligations and expense. 

Sensitivity
        to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of the Company's
        pension plans is as follows: 

The
        Company contributed $3,123 and $4,250 in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively,
        to
        these Company-sponsored pension plans. The Company expects to contribute
        $2,000
        in fiscal 2007 to these plans. 

LIQUIDITY
        AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

CASH
        FLOWS   

          Net
        cash
        provided by operating activities was $35,514 in fiscal 2006 compared to $29,473
        in fiscal 2005. This increase is primarily due to a larger increase in accounts
        payable to related party and accounts payable and accrued expenses in the
        current fiscal year, and increased net income, depreciation and amortization
        expense. These increased cash flows were partially offset by a reduction
        in
        deferred taxes in the current fiscal year compared to increased deferred
        taxes
        in the prior fiscal year. Accounts payable increased more in fiscal 2006
        than in
        fiscal 2005 due to the timing of payments and higher taxes payable. 

During
        fiscal 2006, the Company used cash provided by operating activities to fund
        capital expenditures of $14,296, debt payments of $6,833 and dividends of
        $3,028. Major capital expenditures were the expansion and remodel of the
        Springfield store, an ongoing major remodel of the Rio Grande store and smaller
        remodels of the Elizabeth and Chester stores. Debt payments made include
        the
        third installment of $4,286 on the Company's unsecured Senior
        Notes. 

Net
        cash
        provided by operating activities was $29,473 in fiscal 2005 compared to $30,784
        in fiscal 2004. This decrease is primarily due to less of an increase in
        accounts payable in fiscal 2005 than in fiscal 2004 and lower LIFO charges
        in
        fiscal 2005. These reduced cash flows were partially offset by increases
        in net
        income and depreciation in fiscal 2005 and a smaller increase in patronage
        dividend receivable in fiscal 2005. Accounts payable increased less in fiscal
        2005 than in fiscal 2004 due to the timing of payments. 

During
        fiscal 2005, the Company used $29,473 of operating cash flow and $2,516 of
        proceeds from a partnership distribution to fund capital expenditures of
        $17,933, debt payments of $7,694 and dividends of $1,092. In addition, a
        $20,274
        note receivable from Wakefern matured January 15, 2005 and is included as
        a cash
        equivalent at July 30, 2005 as these funds are invested in a demand deposit
        at
        Wakefern. Major capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 include the expansion
        and
        remodel of the Bernardsville and Springfield stores and equipment for the
        Somers
        Point replacement store. 

LIQUIDITY
        AND DEBT   

          Working
        capital was $44,096, $37,228 and $31,886 at July 29, 2006, July 30, 2005
        and
        July 31, 2004, respectively. Working capital ratios at the same dates were
        1.58,
        1.54 and 1.47 to one, respectively. The Company's working capital needs are
        reduced, since inventory is generally sold by the time payments to Wakefern
        and
        other suppliers are due. 

The
        Company has budgeted approximately $14 million for capital expenditures in
        fiscal 2007. Planned expenditures include the completion of the Rio Grande
        remodel and construction of an anticipated new store in Franklin, New Jersey.
        The Company's primary sources of liquidity in fiscal 2007 are expected to
        be
        cash and cash equivalents on hand at July 29, 2006 and operating cash flow
        generated in fiscal 2007. The Company anticipates cash flow generation in
        fiscal
        2007 to be in the range experienced in the previous three fiscal
        years. 

On
        July
        15, 2004, the Company amended its unsecured revolving loan agreement, which
        would have expired on September 16, 2004. The amended agreement increased
        the
        maximum amount available for borrowings to $20,000 from $15,000. The amended
        agreement expires September 16, 2009. The revolving credit line can be used
        for
        general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under this agreement bears interest
        at
        the prime rate, or at the Eurodollar rate, at the Company's option, plus
        applicable margins based on the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. There
        were no amounts outstanding at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005. 

The
        revolving loan agreement contains covenants which, among other matters, require
        a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio, a minimum fixed charge
        coverage ratio and a positive net income. At July 29, 2006, the Company was
        in
        compliance with all terms and covenants of the revolving loan
        agreement. 

In
        addition, the Company's Senior Note agreement contains covenants which, among
        other matters, require certain levels of net worth, a minimum fixed charge
        coverage ratio, lien limitations and limitations on additional indebtedness.
        At
        July 29, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all terms and covenants
        of
        this debt agreement. 

The
        lease
        for the Somers Point replacement store has been accounted for as a capital
        lease, resulting in additions to long-term debt and property, equipment and
        fixtures of $11,382 during fiscal 2005. 

During
        fiscal 2006, the Company declared cash dividends of $2,172, comprised of
        $.81
        per Class A common share and $.528 per Class B common share. During fiscal
        2005,
        the Company declared cash dividends of $1,510, comprised of $.57 per Class
        A
        common share and $.371 per Class B common share.

        DUE BY FISCAL PERIOD 

(1) 

In
                  addition, the Company is obligated to purchase 85% of its primary
                  merchandise requirements from Wakefern (see Note
                  3). 

(2) 

Interest
                  expense on long-term debt outstanding at July 29, 2006 is estimated
                  to be
                  as follows in future fiscal years: 2007 - $1,321; 2008 - $915;
                  2009 -
                  $539; 2010 - $180; and none thereafter. Interest expense on variable
                  rate
                  borrowings related to an interest rate swap agreement is based
                  on
                  estimates of LIBOR plus 3.36% for the length of that agreement.
                  The
                  estimate of interest expense does not include interest expense
                  related to
                  capital leases as the total amount of capital lease payments, including
                  principal and interest, are included in the above
                  table. 

(3) 

The
                  above amounts for capital leases and operating leases do not include
                  certain obligations under these leases for other charges. These
                  charges
                  consisted of the following in fiscal 2006: real estate taxes -
                  $2,828;
                  common area maintenance -$1,574; insurance - $229; and contingent
                  rentals
                  - $1,117. 

NEW
        ACCOUNTING STANDARDS   

          In
        June
        2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
        Interpretation (FIN) No 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
        Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive
        model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose
        in its
        financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or
        expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 states that a tax benefit from an
        uncertain position may be recognized if it is "more likely than not" that
        the
        position is sustainable, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of
        a
        qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
        than 50
        percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing
        authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company
        currently recognizes a tax position if it is probable of being sustained.
        FIN 48
        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
        is
        currently evaluating the impact that adopting FIN 48 will have on its operations
        and financial condition. 

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FASB No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements".
        FASB
        157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out
        a
        framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about
        fair value measurements. FASB 157 applies only to fair value measurements
        that
        are already required or permitted by other accounting standards. FASB 157
        is
        effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
        is
        currently evaluating the impact that adopting FASB 157 will have on its
        operations and financial condition. 

In
        September, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff
        Accounting Bulletin 108 ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides interpretative guidance
        on
        how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements
        should
        be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective
        for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company is currently
        evaluating the impact that adopting SAB 108 will have on its operations and
        financial condition. 

In
        November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 123(R)-3 ("FSP 123R-3"),
        "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-based
        Payment Awards," that provides an elective alternative transition method
        of
        calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies
        recognized subsequent to the adoption of FASB 123R (the "APIC Pool") to the
        method otherwise required by paragraph 81 of FASB 123R. The Company may take
        up
        to one year from the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available
        alternatives and make its one-time election. The Company is currently evaluating
        the alternative methods. Until and unless the Company elects the transition
        method described in this FSP, the Company will follow the transition method
        described in paragraph 81 of FASB 123R. 

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FASB No. 158, "Employer's Accounting for
        Defined
        Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans". FASB 158 requires employers
        to
        recognize the funded status of pension and other post retirement benefit
        plans
        on the balance sheet. FASB 158 does not change the amounts recognized in
        the
        income statement as net periodic benefit cost. FASB 158 is effective for
        fiscal
        years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating
        the
        impact that adopting FASB 158 will have on its financial condition. 

RELATED
        PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

          The
        Company holds an investment in Wakefern, its principal supplier. The Company
        purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern in accordance
        with
        the Wakefern Stockholder Agreement. As part of this agreement, the Company
        is
        required to purchase certain amounts of Wakefern common stock. At July 29,
        2006,
        the Company's indebtedness to Wakefern for the outstanding amount of this
        stock
        subscription was $798. On September 21, 2006, this amount increased by $550.
        Wakefern distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each member a share of
        its
        earnings in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by the member from
        Wakefern during the year. Additional information is provided in Note 3 to
        the
        consolidated financial statements. 

At
        July
        29, 2006 the Company had demand deposits invested at Wakefern in the amount
        of
        $57,354. These deposits earn the prime rate of interest less 2.5% or overnight
        money market rates. 

The
        Company subleases the Vineland store from Wakefern at a current annual rent
        of
        $700. The annual rent increases to $750 in fiscal 2009.

VILLAGE
        SUPER MARKET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

MANAGEMENT'S
        DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  

         CONDITION
        AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (Continued) 

Beginning
        in fiscal 2014, the Company has options to extend this lease at increasing
        annual rents. 

The
        Company leases a supermarket from a realty firm partly owned by officers
        of the
        Company. The Company paid rent to this related party of $565, $549 and $549
        in
        fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This lease expires in fiscal
        2011 with options to extend at increasing annual rents. 

The
        Company has ownership interests in four real estate partnerships. The Company
        paid aggregate rents to two of these partnerships for leased stores of
        approximately $724, $634 and $638 in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
        respectively. 

IMPACT
        OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES   

          Although
        the Company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation or
        deflation on its operations, it estimates that product prices overall
        experienced less inflation in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 than in fiscal
        2004.
        The Company recorded a pre-tax LIFO charge of $256, $425 and $1,402 in fiscal
        2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The company calculates LIFO charges based
        on
        a regional CPI index for food at home published by the Department of Labor,
        which indicated CPI increases of 1.9%, 2.5% and 6.5% in fiscal 2006, 2005
        and
        2004, respectively. 

MARKET
        RISK   

          The
        Company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest
        rates. During fiscal 2006, the Company's only variable rate borrowings relate
        to
        an interest rate swap agreement. On October 18, 2001, the Company entered
        into
        an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution pursuant
        to
        which the Company pays a variable rate of six-month LIBOR plus 3.36% (8.92%
        at
        July 29, 2006) on an initial notional amount of $10,000, expiring in September
        2009, in exchange for a fixed rate of 8.12%. The swap agreement notional
        amount
        decreases in amounts and on dates corresponding to the repayment of the fixed
        rate obligation it hedges. At July 29, 2006, the remaining notional amount
        of
        the swap agreement was $5,714. A 1% increase in interest rates, applied to
        the
        Company's borrowings at July 29, 2006, would result in an annual increase
        in
        interest expense and a corresponding reduction in cash flow of approximately
        $57. The fair value of the Company's fixed rate debt is also affected by
        changes
        in interest rates. 

At
        July
        29, 2006, the Company had demand deposits of $57,354 at Wakefern earning
        interest at prime less 2.5%, or overnight money market rates, which are exposed
        to the impact of interest rate changes.

NOTES
        TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE
        1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

         (All
        amounts are in thousands, except per share and sq. ft. data)  

NATURE
        OF OPERATIONS  

Village
        Super Market, Inc. operates a chain of 23 ShopRite supermarkets in New Jersey
        and eastern Pennsylvania. The Company is a member of Wakefern Food Corporation
        ("Wakefern"), the largest retailer-owned food cooperative in the United
        States. 

PRINCIPLES
        OF CONSOLIDATION  

The
        consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Village Super Market,
        Inc. and its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned. Intercompany balances
        and
        transactions have been eliminated. 

FISCAL
        YEAR  

The
        Company and its subsidiaries utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the
        last
        Saturday in the month of July. Fiscal 2004 contains 53 weeks. Fiscal 2006
        and
        2005 contain 52 weeks. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS  

Certain
        amounts have been reclassified in the fiscal 2005 consolidated financial
        statements to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation. 

INDUSTRY
        SEGMENT  

The
        Company consists of one operating segment, the retail sale of food and non-food
        products. 

REVENUE
        RECOGNITION  

Merchandise
        sales are recognized at the point of sale to the customer. Discounts provided
        to
        customers through ShopRite coupons and loyalty programs are recognized as
        a
        reduction of sales as the products are sold. 

CASH
        AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

The
        Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity
        of
        three months or less and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions
        with settlement terms of less than five days to be cash equivalents. Included
        in
        cash and cash equivalents at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005 are $57,354
        and
        $41,449, respectively, of demand deposits invested at Wakefern at the prime
        rate
        less 2.5% or at overnight money market rates. 

MERCHANDISE
        INVENTORIES  

Approximately
        70% of merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of LIFO (last-in,
        first-out) cost or market. If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been
        used, inventories would have been $11,795 and $11,539 higher than reported
        in
        fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. All other inventories are stated at the
        lower of FIFO cost or market. 

VENDOR
        ALLOWANCES AND REBATES  

The
        Company receives vendor allowances and rebates, including the patronage dividend
        and amounts received as a pass through from Wakefern, related to the Company's
        buying and merchandising activities. Vendor allowances and rebates are
        recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related merchandise is
        sold
        or when the required contractual terms are completed. 

PROPERTY,
        EQUIPMENT AND FIXTURES  

Property,
        equipment and fixtures are recorded at cost. Interest cost incurred to finance
        construction is capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. Maintenance
        and
        repairs are expensed as incurred. 

Depreciation
        is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of thirty
        years
        for buildings, ten years for store fixtures and equipment, and three years
        for
        vehicles. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the related
        lease terms or the estimated useful lives of the related assets. 

When
        assets are sold or retired, their cost and accumulated depreciation are removed
        from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated
        financial statements. 

INVESTMENTS  

The
        Company's investments in its principal supplier, Wakefern, and a Wakefern
        affiliate, Insure-Rite, Ltd., are stated at cost (see Note 3). The Company
        evaluates its investments in Wakefern and Insure-Rite, Ltd. For impairment
        through consideration of previous, current and projected levels of profit
        of
        those entities. 

The
        Company's 20%-50% investments in certain real estate partnerships are accounted
        for under the equity method. One of these partnerships is a variable interest
        entity under FASB Interpretation No. 46 (Revised), "Consolidation of Variable
        Interest Entities", which does not require consolidation as the Company is
        not
        the primary beneficiary (see Note 6). 

STORE
        OPENING AND CLOSING COSTS  

All
        store
        opening costs are expensed as incurred. The Company records a liability for
        the
        future minimum lease payments and related costs for closed stores from the
        date
        of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated cost
        recoveries that may be achieved through subletting, discounted using a
        risk-adjusted interest rate. 

The
        Company closed a stand-alone drugstore on December 5, 2004 and remains obligated
        for future lease commitments for this store. The Company recorded a $576
        charge
        in fiscal 2005, which is included in operating and administrative expense
        in the
        consolidated statement of operations. On March 1, 2006, the Company exercised
        an
        option to extend this lease for competitive purposes. Accordingly, the Company
        no longer accounts for this lease commitment as an exit activity and reversed
        the remaining $211 liability in fiscal 2006. 

LEASES  

Leases
        which meet certain criteria are classified as capital leases, and assets
        and
        liabilities are recorded at amounts equal to the lesser of the present value
        of
        the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased properties at
        the
        inception of the respective leases. Such assets are amortized on a straight-line
        basis over the shorter of the related lease terms or the   estimated
        useful lives of the related assets. Amounts representing interest expense
        relating to the lease obligations are recorded to effect constant rates of
        interest over the terms of the leases. Leases which do not qualify as capital
        leases are classified as operating leases, and related rentals are charged
        to
        expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. 

ADVERTISING  

Advertising
        costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $7,554, $7,793 and
        $7,692 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

INCOME
        TAXES  

Deferred
        tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
        attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
        of
        existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred
        tax
        assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
        to
        taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
        to
        be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
        of a
        change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes
        the
        enactment date.

NOTE

        (Continued) 

COMPREHENSIVE
        INCOME  

For
        fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, comprehensive income consists of net income and
        the
        additional minimum pension liability adjustment, net of income
        taxes. 

USE
        OF ESTIMATES  

In
        conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management
        of the
        Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting
        of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
        liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
        reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Some of the more
        significant estimates are patronage dividends, pension accounting assumptions
        and the impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill. Actual results could
        differ from those estimates. 

FAIR
        VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Cash
        and
        cash equivalents, patronage dividends receivable, accounts payable and accrued
        expenses are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at carrying
        value which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of
        these
        instruments. The Company's derivative instrument is carried at fair value.
        The
        carrying value of the Company's short and long-term notes payable approximates
        their fair value based on the current rates available to the Company for
        similar
        instruments. As the Company's investments in Wakefern can only be sold to
        Wakefern at amounts that approximate the Company's cost, it is not practicable
        to estimate the fair value of such investments. 

DERIVATIVE
        INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  

The
        Company accounts for its limited activities involving derivative and hedging
        transactions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
        Activities," as amended. This statement establishes accounting and reporting
        standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities and requires
        an
        entity to recognize all derivative instruments either as an asset or a liability
        in the balance sheet and to measure such instruments at fair value. These
        fair
        value adjustments are included either in the determination of net income
        or as a
        component of accumulated other comprehensive income depending on the nature
        of
        the transaction. 

The
        Company has one derivative instrument, an interest rate swap agreement, which
        it
        entered into in October 2001, to manage its exposure to interest rate
        fluctuations (see Note 4). The Company has structured this swap agreement
        to be
        an effective, fair value hedge of the underlying fixed rate obligation. The
        changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and the underlying
        fixed rate obligation are recorded as equal and offsetting unrealized gains
        and
        losses in interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. As
        a
        result, there is no impact to earnings resulting from hedge ineffectiveness.
        The
        Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of the inability of the counter
        party to perform under its outstanding derivative contract. Management believes
        it has minimized such risk by entering into a transaction with a counter
        party
        that is a major financial institution with a high credit rating. 

LONG-LIVED
        ASSETS  

The
        Company reviews long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and fixtures
        and
        intangibles subject to amortization, on an individual store basis for impairment
        when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not
        be
        recoverable. Such review analyzes the undiscounted estimated future cash
        flows
        from such assets to determine if the carrying value of such assets are
        recoverable from their respective cash flows. If an impairment is indicated,
        it
        is measured by comparing the discounted cash flows for the long-lived assets
        to
        their carrying value. 

GOODWILL  

Goodwill
        is tested at the end of each fiscal year, or as circumstances dictate, for
        impairment pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other
        Intangible Assets." An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the
        carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company operates
        as a single reporting unit for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment
        and primarily considers earnings multiples and other valuation techniques
        to
        measure fair value as its stock is not widely traded. 

NET
        INCOME PER SHARE  

The
        number of common shares outstanding for calculation of net income per share
        is
        as follows: 

In
        accordance with SFAS No. 128 and EITF Issue No. 03-6, the Company utilizes
        the
        if-converted method of calculating net income per share, as the dilutive
        effect
        on basic net income per share using the if-converted method is greater than
        that
        which would result from the application of the two-class method. Options
        to
        purchase 2 Class A shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net
        income per share at July 29, 2006 as a result of their anti-dilutive effect
        (none in fiscal 2005 and 2004).

SHARE-BASED
        COMPENSATION  

The
        Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment," on May 1, 2005 utilizing
        the modified prospective application. SFAS 123(R) requires all share-based
        payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements as
        compensation costs based on the fair market value on the date of the grant.
        As
        the Company had previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions
        of SFAS
        No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation;" during fiscal 2003, the
        adoption of SFAS 123(R) had no impact on the consolidated results of operations
        for fiscal 2005. 

NEW
        ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

In
        June
        2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB
        Interpretation (FIN) No 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
        Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109." FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive
        model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose
        in its
        financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or
        expects to take on a tax return. FIN 48 states that a tax benefit from an
        uncertain position may be recognized if it is "more likely than not" that
        the
        position is sustainable, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of
        a
        qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater
        than 50
        percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing
        authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company
        currently recognizes a tax position if it is probable of being sustained.
        FIN 48
        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
        is
        currently evaluating the impact that adopting FIN 48 will have on its operations
        and financial condition. 

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FASB No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements".
        FASB
        157 establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out
        a
        framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about
        fair value measurements. FASB 157 applies only to fair value measurements
        that
        are already required or permitted by other accounting standards. FASB 157
        is
        effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company
        is
        currently evaluating the impact that adopting FASB 157 will have on its
        operations and financial condition. 

In
        September, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff
        Accounting Bulletin 108 ("SAB 108"). SAB 108 provides interpretative guidance
        on
        how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements
        should
        be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. SAB 108 is effective
        for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006. The Company is currently
        evaluating the impact that adopting SAB 108 will have on its operations and
        financial condition. 

In
        November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 123(R)-3 ("FSP 123R-3"),
        "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-based
        Payment Awards," that provides an elective alternative transition method
        of
        calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies
        recognized subsequent to the adoption of FASB 123R (the "APIC Pool") to the
        method otherwise required by paragraph 81 of FASB 123R. The Company may take
        up
        to one year from the effective date of this FSP to evaluate its available
        alternatives and make its one-time election. The Company is currently evaluating
        the alternative methods. Until and unless the Company elects the transition
        method described in this FSP, the Company will follow the transition method
        described in paragraph 81 of FASB 123R. 

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued FASB No. 158, "Employer's Accounting for
        Defined
        Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans". FASB 158 requires employers
        to
        recognize the funded status of pension and other post retirement benefit
        plans
        on the balance sheet. FASB 158 does not change the amounts recognized in
        the
        income statement as net periodic benefit cost. FASB 158 is effective for
        fiscal
        years ending after December 15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating
        the
        impact that adopting FASB 158 will have on its financial condition.

NOTE
        3 -- RELATED PARTY INFORMATION - WAKEFERN  

The
        Company's ownership interest in its principal supplier, Wakefern, which is
        operated on a cooperative basis for its stockholder members, is 15.9% of
        the
        outstanding shares of Wakefern at July 29, 2006. The investment is pledged
        as
        collateral for any obligations to Wakefern. In addition, all obligations
        to
        Wakefern are personally guaranteed by the principal shareholders of the
        Company. 

The
        Company is obligated to purchase 85% of its primary merchandise requirements
        from Wakefern until ten years from the date that stockholders representing
        75%
        of Wakefern sales notify Wakefern that those stockholders request that the
        Wakefern Stockholder Agreement be terminated. If this purchase obligation
        is not
        met, the Company is required to pay Wakefern's profit contribution shortfall
        attributable to this failure. Similar payments are due if Wakefern loses
        volume
        by reason of the sale of Company stores or a merger with another entity.
        The
        Company fulfilled the above obligation in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004. The
        Company also has an investment of approximately 8.5% in Insure-Rite, Ltd.,
        a
        Wakefern affiliated company, that provides the Company with liability and
        property insurance coverage. 

Wakefern
        has increased from time to time the required investment in its common stock
        for
        each supermarket owned by a member, with the exact amount per store computed
        based on the amount of each store's purchases from Wakefern. At July 29,
        2006,
        the Company's indebtedness to Wakefern for the outstanding amount of these
        stock
        subscriptions was $798. Installment payments are due as follows: 2007 - $580;
        2008 - $91; 2009 - $101; and 2010 - $26. The maximum per store investment
        increased to $675 (from $650) on September 21, 2006, resulting in an additional
        $550 investment due to be paid in fiscal 2007. The Company will receive
        additional shares of common stock to the extent paid for at the end of each
        fiscal year (September 30) of Wakefern calculated at the then book value
        of such
        shares. The payments, together with any stock issued thereunder, at the option
        of Wakefern, may be null and void and all payments on this subscription shall
        become the property of Wakefern in the event the Company does not complete
        the
        payment of this subscription in a timely manner. 

The
        Company purchases substantially all of its merchandise from Wakefern. Wakefern
        distributes as a "patronage dividend" to each member a share of its earnings
        in
        proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by the member from Wakefern
        during
        the year. Patronage dividends and other product incentives and rebates amounted
        to $12,808, $12,363 and $12,252 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004,
        respectively. 

Wakefern
        provides the Company with support services in numerous areas including
        advertising, supplies, liability and property insurance, technology support
        and
        other store services. The Company incurred charges of $19,856, $20,011 and
        $19,686 from Wakefern in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for these
        services, which are reflected in operating and administrative expense in
        the
        consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, the Company has certain
        related party leases (see Note 6) and demand deposits invested at Wakefern
        (see
        Note 1).

NOTE
        4 -- DEBT  

Aggregate
        principal maturities of notes payable as of July 29, 2006 are as
        follows: 

(a)
        On
        September 16, 1999, the Company issued $30,000 of 8.12% unsecured Senior
        Notes.
        Interest on these notes is due semi-annually. The principal is due in seven
        equal annual installments beginning September 16, 2003 and ending September
        16,
        2009. 

The
        Senior Note agreement contains covenants which, among other matters, require
        certain levels of net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, lien
        limitations and limitations on additional indebtedness. At July 29, 2006,
        the
        Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of this debt
        agreement. 

On
        October 18, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement
        with
        a major financial institution pursuant to which the Company pays a variable
        rate
        of six-month LIBOR plus 3.36% (8.92% at July 29, 2006) on a notional amount
        of
        $10,000 expiring in September 2009 in exchange for a fixed rate of 8.12%.
        The
        swap agreement notional amount ($5,714 at July 29, 2006) decreases in amounts
        and on dates corresponding to the repayment of the fixed rate obligation
        it
        hedges. This interest rate swap agreement increased interest expense by $10
        in
        fiscal 2006 and reduced interest expense by $92 and $289 in fiscal 2005 and
        2004, respectively. The Company has structured this interest rate swap agreement
        to be an effective, fair value hedge. 

(b)
        On
        July 15, 2004, the Company amended its unsecured revolving loan agreement,
        which
        would have expired on September 16, 2004. The amended agreement increased
        the
        maximum amount available for borrowings to $20,000 from $15,000. The amended
        agreement expires September 16, 2009. The revolving credit line can be used
        for
        general corporate purposes. Indebtedness under this agreement bears interest
        at
        the prime rate, or at the Eurodollar rate, at the Company's option, plus
        applicable margins based on the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio. There
        were no amounts outstanding at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005. 

The
        revolving loan agreement provides a maximum commitment for letters of credit
        of
        $3,000 ($340 outstanding at July 29, 2006) to secure obligations for
        self-insured workers' compensation claims from 1995 to 1998 and construction
        performance guarantees to municipalities. 

This
        loan
        agreement contains covenants which, among other matters, require a maximum
        liabilities to tangible net worth ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage
        ratio
        and a positive net income. At July 29, 2006, the Company was in compliance
        with
        all financial covenants of the revolving loan agreement.

NOTE
        5 -- INCOME TAXES  

The
        components of the provision for income taxes are: 

Deferred
        income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
        the
        carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
        and
        the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the
        Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets are as follows: 

Net
        current deferred taxes of $1,244 and $1,589 are included in accounts payable
        and
        accrued expenses at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005, respectively. 

A
        valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
        portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In management's
        opinion, in view of the Company's previous, current and projected taxable
        income
        and reversal of deferred tax liabilities, such tax assets will more likely
        than
        not be fully realized. Accordingly, no valuation allowance was deemed to
        be
        required at July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005. 

The
        effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate

NOTE
        6 -- LEASES  

DESCRIPTION
        OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS  

The
        Company conducts a major part of its operations from leased facilities, with
        the
        majority of initial lease terms ranging from 20 to 30 years. 

Most
        of
        the Company's leases contain renewal options of five years each. These options
        enable the Company to retain the use of facilities in desirable operating
        areas.
        Management expects that in the normal course of business, most leases will
        be
        renewed or replaced by other leases. The Company is obligated under all leases
        to pay for real estate taxes, utilities and liability insurance, and under
        certain leases to pay additional amounts based on maintenance and a percentage
        of sales in excess of stipulated amounts. 

Future
        minimum lease payments by year and in the aggregate for all non-cancelable
        leases with initial terms of one year or more consist of the following at
        July
        29, 2006: 

The
        following schedule shows the composition of total rental expense for the

        PARTY LEASES  

The
        Company leases a supermarket from a realty firm 30% owned by officers of
        the
        Company. The Company paid rent to related parties under this lease of $565,
        $549
        and $549 in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This lease expires
        in fiscal 2011 with options to extend at increasing annual rents. 

The
        Company is a limited partner in a real estate partnership that sold its only
        asset and distributed the proceeds to the partners in fiscal 2005. The Company
        received proceeds of $3,096 and recorded income from the partnership of $1,509,
        which is the excess of the proceeds above the Company's investment in the
        partnership and certain receivables due from the partnership. 

The
        Company has ownership interests in four real estate partnerships. The Company
        paid aggregate rents to two of these partnerships for leased stores of $724,
        $634 and $638 in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. 

One
        of
        these partnerships is a variable interest entity, which is not consolidated
        as
        the Company is not the primary beneficiary. This partnership owns one property,
        a stand-alone supermarket leased to the Company since 1974. The Company is
        a
        general partner entitled to 33% of the partnerships profits and
        losses. 

The
        Company leases its Vineland store from Wakefern under a sublease agreement
        which
        provides for annual rent of $700. The annual rent increases to $750 in fiscal
        2009. Beginning in fiscal 2014 the Company has options to extend this lease
        at
        increasing annual rents.

NOTE
        7 -- SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY  

Class
        A
        common stock has one vote per share and is entitled to cash dividends as
        declared 54% greater than those paid on Class B common stock. Class B common
        stock has ten votes per share. Class B common stock is not transferable except
        to another holder of Class B common stock or by will or under the laws of
        intestacy or pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company
        approving the transfer. Shares of Class B common stock are convertible on
        a
        share-for-share basis for Class A common stock. 

The
        Company has authorized 10,000 shares of preferred stock. No shares have been
        issued. The Board of Directors is authorized to designate series, preferences,
        powers and participations of any preferred stock issued. 

The
        Company has two share-based compensation plans, which are described below.
        The
        compensation cost charged against income for these plans was $1,053, $483
        and
        $80 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Total income tax benefit
        recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for share-based
        compensation arrangements was $307 and $150 in fiscal 2006 and 2005 (none
        in
        2004). 

The
        1997
        Incentive and Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan (the "1997 Plan") provides
        for the
        granting of options to purchase up to 250 shares of the Company's Class A
        common
        stock by officers, employees and directors of the Company as designated by
        the
        Board of Directors. The Plan requires incentive stock options to be granted
        at
        exercise prices equal to the fair value of the Company's stock at the date
        of
        grant (110% if the optionee holds more than 10% of the voting stock of the
        Company), while non-qualified options may be granted at an exercise price
        less
        than fair value. All options granted under this plan were at fair value,
        vest
        over a one-year service period and are exercisable up to ten years from the
        date
        of grant. At July 31, 2004 there were no shares remaining for future grants
        under the 1997 Plan. 

On
        December 10, 2004, the shareholders of the Company approved the Village Super
        Market, Inc. 2004 Stock Plan (the "2004 Plan") under which awards of incentive
        and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock may be made. There are
        300
        shares of Class A common stock authorized for issuance to employees and
        directors under the 2004 Plan. Terms and conditions of awards are determined
        by
        the Board of Directors. Option awards are primarily granted at the fair value
        of
        the Company's stock at the date of grant, cliff vest three years from the
        grant
        date and are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant. Restricted
        stock awards primarily cliff vest three years from the grant date. 

The
        following table summarizes option activity under both plans for the following
        periods: 

As
        of
        July 29, 2006, the weighted-average remaining contractual term of options
        outstanding and options exercisable was 7.5 years and 3.6 years, respectively.
        As of July 29, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding
        and
        options exercisable was $3,262 and $1,396, respectively. The weighted-average
        grant date fair value of options granted was $24.81, $13.33 and $11.39 per
        share
        in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The total intrinsic value of
        options exercised was $54, $763 and $1,331 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004.
        The
        fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the
        Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model using the weighted-average assumptions
        in the
        following table. The Company uses historical data for similar groups of
        employees in order to estimate the expected life of options granted. Expected
        volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock for
        a
        period of years corresponding to the expected life of the option. The risk
        free
        interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant
        for
        securities with a maturity period similar to the expected life of the
        option.

        fiscal 2006 and 2005: 

As
        of
        July 29, 2006, there was $1,887 of total unrecognized compensation costs
        related

        plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period
        of
        1.8 years. The total fair value of restricted shares vested during fiscal
        2005
        was $165 (none in fiscal 2006 and 2004). 

Cash
        received from option exercises under all share-based compensation arrangements

NOTE
        8 -- PENSION PLANS  

The
        Company sponsors four defined benefit pension plans. Two are tax-qualified
        plans
        covering members of unions. Benefits under these two plans are based on a
        fixed
        amount for each year of service. One is a tax-qualified plan covering nonunion
        associates. Benefits under this plan are based upon percentages of annual
        compensation. The fourth plan is an unfunded, nonqualified plan providing
        supplemental pension benefits to certain executives. Funding for these plans
        is
        based on an analysis of the specific requirements and an evaluation of the
        assets and liabilities of each plan. The Company uses its fiscal year-end
        date
        as the measurement date for these plans. 

Net
        periodic pension cost for the four plans include the following
        components: 

The
        changes in benefit obligations and the reconciliation of the funded status
        of
        the Company's plans to the consolidated balance sheets were as
        follows: 

Each
        of
        the Company's four defined benefit pension plans has accumulated benefit
        obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets. The accumulated benefit
        obligations of the four plans were $20,958 and $21,454 at July 29, 2006 and
        July
        30, 2005, respectively. The provisions of SFAS No. 87, "Employer's Accounting
        for Pensions," require recognition in the consolidated balance sheet of
        additional minimum liability and a related intangible asset for pension plans
        with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Any portion
        of
        such additional liability which is in excess of the plan's prior service
        costs
        is a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and is reflected in
        shareholder's equity, net of related tax benefit.

Assumptions
        used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic pension cost for the
        Company's defined benefit plans were as follows: 

The
        expected rate of return on plan assets represents the weighted average of
        expected returns for each asset category. The expected returns for each asset
        category are developed using historical data on returns. The defined benefit
        pension plans weighted average asset allocations by asset category were as
        follows: 

Investments
        in the pension trusts are overseen by the trustees of the plans, who are
        officers of the Company. Overall investment strategy and policy has been
        developed based on the need to satisfy the long-term liabilities of the
        Company's pension plans. Risk management is accomplished through diversification
        across asset classes, multiple investment portfolios and investment guidelines.
        Equity investments consist of publicly traded securities and investments
        in
        broad market index funds. In addition, one plan held Class A common stock
        of the
        Company in the amount of $1,133 and $1,419 at July 29, 2006 and July 30,
        2005,
        respectively. Fixed income securities consist of a broad range of investments
        including U.S. government securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage
        backed
        obligations, and short-term bond mutual funds. The plans do not allow for
        investments in derivative instruments. 

The
        Company estimates future defined benefit payments from plan assets as
        follows: 

The
        Company expects to contribute $2,000 in cash to all defined benefit pension
        plans in fiscal 2007. 

The
        Company also participates in several multi-employer pension plans for which
        the
        fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 contributions were $4,695, $4,142 and $3,987,
        respectively. 

The
        Company sponsors a 401(k) savings plan for certain eligible associates. Company
        contributions under that plan, which are based on specified percentages of
        associate contributions, were $247, $225 and $214 in fiscal 2006, 2005 and
        2004,
        respectively. 

NOTE
        9 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

The
        Company is involved in litigation incidental to the normal course of business.
        Company management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these

        financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders 

        Village
        Super Market, Inc.: 

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Village Super Market,
        Inc. and subsidiaries as of July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005 and the related
        consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive
        income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
        July
        29, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
        of the
        Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
        consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In
        our
        opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
        fairly,
        in all material respects, the financial position of Village Super Market,
        Inc.
        and subsidiaries as of July 29, 2006 and July 30, 2005, and the results of
        their
        operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
        ended July 29, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
        principles.
