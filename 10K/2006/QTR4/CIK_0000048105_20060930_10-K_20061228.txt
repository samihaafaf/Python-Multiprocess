PART I
                                -------
Item 1.  Business
- -----------------
        (a)	In General.  The Registrant was organized in October,
        ---  ----------
1967, and commenced doing business on January 1, 1968.  The
Registrant is engaged in the rental and development of real estate
and was formerly engaged in developing surgical staples and the
technology used to apply the staples.
        b)	Industry Segments.  For financial information in regard
	--	-----------------
to Industry Segments, reference is made to Note 10 to the Financial
Statements for the year ended September 30, 2006, Note 11 to the
Financial Statements for the year ended 2005, and Note 12 to the
Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 2004.
        (c)	Description of Business.
        ---  -----------------------
               (I)	Principal Activities and
               (ii)	Status of products and Real Estate Properties.
	Medical Staples
                         ---------------
        The Registrant has discontinued its efforts in the area of
medical staples for use in internal surgery.  Several United States
Patents and foreign patents were received covering a novel staple.
 The staple has been produced and animal testing took place during
2003, 2002 and 2001. Final test results indicated insufficient
commercial value for the staple.  As a result, the Registrant
discontinued funding for the project during 2003.
        	Real Estate Development and Rental Activities
             ---------------------------------------------
        The Registrant has rented two buildings it owns located at A&S
Drive, Paramus, New Jersey: one to The Sports Authority, Inc. and
the other to CompUSA, both for retail purposes.
               (iii)	 Raw Materials
        The Registrant believes that the components and materials
necessary or useful to its operations will be available from
diverse sources of supply.  The materials used for the Registrant's
research activities were acquired through commercial businesses
engaged in the distribution of such supplies.
               (iv)	Patents.

        The Registrant has filed several patent applications and has
several
        4

patents issued in connection with medical staples for use in
internal surgery.

These applications and patents are as follows:

21.  Australian Pat. #704533       Improved Staples           08/05/99

During 2003 the Registrant's research activities in connection
with the surgical staples was terminated. As a result, the
unamortized portion of the Patents and Patent Applications costs
associated with the surgical staple project were written off and
charged to operations. Such write-off amounted to $60,052.

        5

(v) Non-seasonal Business.
        The Registrant does not believe that its products are subject
to material seasonal changes.
                 (vi) Working Capital.
        Not relevant.
                (vii) Customers.
        Not relevant.
               (viii) Backlog.
        Not relevant.
                 (ix) Governmental Contracts.  Not relevant.
                  (x) Competition.
        During 2003 the Registrant discontinued its activities with
respect to medical staples and their application.  Results of the
final phase of tests did not indicate sufficient commercial
feasibility for the technology developed by the Registrant and
funding of engineering and research was terminated.
        Competition in the real estate office rental segment of the
Registrant's business activities was significant in the Bergen
County, New Jersey market in which the Registrant competes during
the period when the Registrant was seeking suitable tenants for its
rental properties.
        The obsolete style of the building owned by the Registrant
prior to and during 1991 made the attraction of suitable tenants
difficult.
        In an effort to increase the marketability of the Registrant's
properties, the Registrant applied to the Borough of Paramus for a
zoning change to allow retail use for the office building and for
the adjacent site.

        In December 1991, the necessary change in zoning was approved.
 The then existing building was rented to The Sports Authority,
Inc., a retailer of sporting goods.  This building was
substantially renovated by The Sports Authority, Inc. and Holobeam
reimbursed them for their costs in connection with this renovation.
        During 1994, a 31,000 sq. ft. building was constructed on the
Registrant's site located adjacent to the building leased to The
Sports Authority, Inc. for
        6

use as a Computer City retail store.  Tandy Corp., parent
corporation of Computer City, commenced paying rent in October
1994.  Holobeam reimbursed Tandy Corporation $1,189,675 as an
allowance for costs of constructing the building and paving of the
site, after a permanent Certificate of Occupancy was obtained.
During 1998, Computer City Retail Stores were acquired by Comp USA.
 On January 23, 2000, Comp USA entered into a merger agreement with
Grupo Sanborns, S.A. de C.V. and TPC Acquisition Corp., a
subsidiary of Grupo Sanborns, S.A. de C.V.  Tandy Corp. remains on
the lease as guarantor.
                 (xi) Research and Development.
        The Registrant has investigated methods for applying surgical
staples and the technology presently used to fabricate and apply
such staples.  During 2003, the Registrant expended $172,746. in
connection with the furtherance of this activity.  Such costs were
expensed to operations and consist principally of materials,
supplies and costs associated with design and development.  During
2003 the Registrant terminated funding for the surgical staples
project and no further funds were expended.  (Reference is made to
Form 10Q, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Conditions and Results of Operations for the Quarter Ended June 30,
2003.)
                (xii) Environmental Compliances.
        The Registrant does not believe that compliance with Federal,
State or Local provisions of a governmental nature which have been
enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of material into the
environment will have a materially adverse effect upon the capital
expenditure requirements, earnings or competitive position of the
Registrant.

        The Registrant's activities with regard to medical staple
technology were limited to engineering, development and animal
testing of medical staple design with fabrication and manufacturing
of prototypes and models sub-contracted to other firms.
        The Registrant is not aware of any potential liabilities or
costs associated with the disposal or handling of waste materials
and is not aware of any potential violations of local, state or
federal laws which regulate the
        7

technology.
               (xiii) Employees.
        At September 30, 2006 the Registrant employed three persons as
compared to three persons at September 30, 2005 and three persons
at September 30, 2004.
(d)	Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic
- ---  ------------------------------------------------
Operations and Export Sales.

        The Registrant is not engaged in foreign operations and does
not export to foreign countries.

        The Registrant's headquarters and principal facilities are
located at 217 First Street, Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey 07423-0287. The
Registrant leases approximately 1,000 square feet of office and
laboratory space.  The Registrant owns two retail buildings, one of
62,000 square feet and another of 31,000 square feet located at 50
A&S Drive, Paramus, New Jersey.  One building was placed in service
in October 1994, the other in 1992.

(1)	Includes $3,567,267. of improvements to the building
	repaid to The Sports Authority, Inc. (the Tenant) upon
	closing of the Mortgage, but does not include additional
	amounts expended by The Sports Authority, Inc. since said
	closing.

 	(2)	Includes construction allowance of $1,189,675. for Tandy
		Corporation pursuant to the Operating Lease Agreement.
		(Now Comp USA.)

        (3)	Includes land cost of $218,402 for the 62,000 sq. ft.
        	building.

        (4)	Includes land cost of $234,370 for the 31,000 sq. ft.
        	building.

        In 1983, the Registrant purchased 2.799 acres of land located
in Paramus, New Jersey and adjacent to the building owned by the
Registrant at 50 A&S Drive.  The purchase price was $173,565 which
was paid in cash.  Since 1983, the Registrant incurred costs in the
amount of $60,805 for various improvements and architectural work
relating to development of this property.  During 1992, 1991 and
1990, the Registrant spent $293,784, $78,051 and $50,667
respectively in connection with an application for a use variance
for the site and various site improvements that would enable the
construction of a commercial or retail building on the site.  The
change in zoning to retail use was approved by the Borough of
Paramus in December 1991.  The change in zoning to allow retail use
also required new site plan approval because the change in use
required parking lot re-design and significant additional changes
in order to comply with governmental requirements.

        9
         
        In addition, the Registrant expended $964,505 through
September 30, 1994 for site plan approval and changes, and toward
construction of a building on the site.  No depreciation or
amortization was recorded until the building and site were put into
service. During October 1994, construction was completed by Tandy
Corporation of a retail building on the Registrant's site.  The
building is now being used for a CompUSA retail store.  (Reference
is made to Note 13 to the Registrant's 1994 Financial Statements
and to Item 1, Part X of the 1994 Annual Report on Form 10K.)
        The zoning change approval allowed for retail use of the
property and significantly enhanced the opportunities for
attracting suitable tenants for the site.
        When purchased, the site adjacent to the building owned by the
Registrant, required site engineering and costs to acquire site
plan approval for a building from the appropriate governmental
regulatory authorities.
        In addition, the Registrant expended funds during its efforts
to change the zoning of the property from office use to retail use.
 This change in zoning allowed the Registrant to seek tenants
engaged in retail operations and resulted in the October 1994
tenancy of Computer City.  (Reference is made to Note 12 of the
Financial Statements for the year ended September 30, 1997.)
        The Registrant was not able to lease the property since the
original site plan allowing office use was not approved for retail
use until the Computer City occupancy of October 1994.  The market
for office space had seen significant decline during 1990, 1991,
1992, 1993 and 1994.
        The occupancy rate for the building owned by the Registrant
and under lease to The Sports Authority Inc. for the past five (5)
years is as follows:

2006		100%

2005		100%

2004		100%

2003		100%

2002		100%

        10
         
The building owned by the Registrant and under lease to Tandy
Corp. (now occupied by CompUSA) has been 100% occupied since
October 1994.  A summary of the amounts expended for such
approvals for the three most recent fiscal years during which
such expenditures were made appears below.  No such expenditures
were made in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003,
2004, 2005 or 2006.

The payment of $200,000 during 1992 to Paramus Park was a
one-time fee in connection with removal of an existing deed
restriction which prohibited adjacent retail activity.  The balance
of the payments for site plan approvals were paid to various
engineering, legal and surveying firms in connection with
professional services rendered to obtain governmental approvals.
        No payments to affiliated parties were made in connection with
the zoning changes nor were any payments made to affiliated or
related parties for the acquisition of site plan approval.
        During 1998, Computer City, Inc. retail stores were acquired
by CompUSA, Inc., another retailer of computers, computer
accessories and software.  The Registrant accepted assignment of
the Computer City lease by CompUSA and Tandy Corporation remains on
the lease as the guarantor.

        There are no legal proceedings of a material nature to which
the Registrant is a party other than ordinary, routine litigation
incidental to the business of the Registrant.

         ------------------------------------------
        (a)	The Registrant's common stock is traded on the
over-the-counter market.  The bid price listed (Source: S&P
Comstock) on December 5, 2006 was $41.50. per share.  On July 18,
1983, the Registrant's shares were deleted from the NASDAQ system
when no market maker for the Registrant's common stock any longer
maintained registration as such with the NASDAQ System.
        (b)	The approximate number of holders of Common Stock
securities of the Registrant as of December 5, 2006 was 336.
        (c)	No dividends have been paid or declared on the Common
Stock of the Registrant during the 2006, 2005 or 2004 fiscal years.
 In making decisions regarding the possible payment of dividends,
the Board of Directors considers the Requirements of the Registrant
in such ongoing activities as real estate development and
acquisition and the research, development and engineering efforts
of the Registrant as well as such obligations as mortgages and
debentures.

Item 6.  Selected Financial Data.
- --------------------------------
        Financial information for the five-year period commencing
October 1, 2001 and ending September 30, 2006 is presented below.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
- ----------------------------------------------------------
Condition and
- -------------
 	Overview.
     --------
        	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
             ------------------------------------------
	The preparation of the Registrant's financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying footnotes.  Future events
and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty.
Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of
judgment.  Actual results could differ from those estimates and
such differences may be material to the financial statements.  The
process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and
takes into account such factors
13
 
as historical experience and current and expected economic
conditions.  Historically, actual results have not differed
significantly from those determined using estimates.
        Liquidity.
        ---------
        Cash flows generated from operating activities during 2006
were $353,630. and were produced primarily from the Registrant's
real estate rental properties.
        The Registrant anticipates that cash flows associated with the
Registrant's real estate rental activities will be sufficient to
fund and sustain operations during the terms of the operating
leases on the properties owned by the Registrant in Paramus, New
Jersey.  (Reference is made to Note 3 of the accompanying Financial
Statements for the years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.
        The minimum future rental income associated with the non-
cancelable operating leases approximates $10,700,000. and is
expected to generate sufficient cash flows to support the
Registrant's activities through 2012 when The Sports Authority,
Inc.'s operating lease expires.
        During 2006 the Registrant's Working Capital increased to
$285,905. which represents an increase of $139,684. when compared
to the Registrant's Working Capital at September 30, 2005.  Such
increase results principally from increases in Trading Assets and
Prepaid Pension costs.
        It is the opinion of the Registrant that cash flows associated
with its real estate rental activities will be sufficient to
maintain liquidity during the terms of the operating leases.
	Capital Resources.
     -----------------
        During 2006 the Registrant contributed $275,114. to its
defined benefit pension plan.  The contribution is charged to
operations during each quarter of the Registrant's fiscal year in
amounts sufficient to fully provide for all eligible employees'
benefits by the time they retire.  During 2005 an additional
minimum liability has been recognized as unfunded accrued pension
cost of $126,454., net of tax and is shown in
        14
         
the statement of changes in stockholders' equity under other
comprehensive loss for a total accumulated other comprehensive loss
of $221,285.  During 2006 there was no additional minimum liability
requirement and thus other comprehensive income adjustment of
$221,285. was reversed. The Registrant expects to continue funding
the plan in 2007 and expects no materially adverse effect upon its
financial condition.  (Reference is made to Notes 13 and 14 of the
accompanying financial statements for the years ended September 30,
2005 and Note 12 and 13 for the year ended September 30, 2006.)
        At the present time the Registrant's rental properties,
located at 50 A&S Drive, Paramus, New Jersey do not require
renovation or refurbishment and none are planned for 2007.  The
tenants are responsible for real estate taxes, maintenance expenses
and insurance costs.  The Registrant's projected costs and expenses
associated with these properties is limited to depreciation and
costs that are routine, normal and incidental to its real estate
rental activities.
        The Registrant has investigated potential sites in the Bergen
County, New Jersey area where it conducts its present real estate
rental activities.  It is the primary intention of the Registrant
to locate and develop suitable properties in the area of Bergen
County, New Jersey, although suitable properties in other locations
would be considered.
        During meetings with local real estate brokers planning for
the future leasing situation, the lack of direct access to New
Jersey Route 17 could be a serious detriment to the Registrant's
ability to attract suitable replacement tenants when the lease
terms expire.
        A Shell Oil Co. gasoline station presently blocks such direct
access to the highway and there was some possibility that the owner
might sell the property.  Discussions have terminated because the
terms offered were unacceptable to Registrant.
        Any purchase of new properties is not expected to have a
materially adverse effect upon the Registrant's capital resources
or financial
        15

condition.
(3)	Results of Operations.
- ---  ---------------------
        (a)	Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005.  During the year
ended September 30, 2006, the Registrant recorded after-tax income
in the amount of $367,869., which represents a decrease of
$112,916. when compared to the income recorded in 2005.  Earnings
per weighted average number of common shares outstanding were $1.37
and $1.78, respectively.
        Revenues for the year were $2,144,675., up $65,578. from 2005
due to realized gains and interest on investments.  (Reference is
made to Note 1.j to financial statements.)
        The costs and expenses for the year ended September 30, 2006
were $1,512,446., up $145,411, as compared to $1,367,035. for the
year ended September 30, 2005.  The increase in expenses was
primarily due to severance paid to the Estate of the former
Treasurer and increase in executive compensation.
        (b)	Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004. During the year
ended September 30, 2005, the Registrant recorded after-tax income
in the amount of $480,785., which represents an increase of
$295,849. when compared to the income recorded in 2004.  Earnings
per weighted average number of common shares outstanding were $1.78
and $0.68, respectively.
        Revenues for the year were $2,079,097., up $20,749. from 2004.
 The increase results principally from unrealized gains from
trading assets stated at fair value.  (Reference is made to Note 1k
to the Registrant's financial statements.)
        Total costs and expenses for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2005 were $1,367,035. as compared to $1,708,489. for the year
ended September 30, 2004.  The decrease costs resulted primarily
from a decrease in pension service costs.  (Reference is made to
Note 13 of the Registrant's financial statements.)
        The Registrant's rental properties had occupancy rates of 100%
during 2006 and 2005 and such rates are expected to continue
through
16

September 30, 2009 when the CompUSA lease expires.  Rental expenses
for which the Registrant is responsible are expected to increase at
or below the inflation rate for the geographical area in which the
Registrant conducts its real estate rental activities.
        These inflationary increases are not expected to adversely
affect the Registrant's results of operations or financial
condition.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
- ------------------------------
        As of September 30, 2006 the Registrant had no off-balance
sheet arrangements.
Contractual Commitments
- -----------------------
        The following table represents the Registrant's contractual
commitments associated with long term debt and other obligations at
September 30, 2006.

Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Risk.
- ----
        The Registrant has operating leases with tenants for the two
properties it owns.  The leases expire in 2009 and 2012.  The
primary market risk is the possibility that one or both tenants
will default on the lease prior to the end of the lease term.  If
tenants had defaulted on the leases at the beginning of 2006, the
Registrant would have been impacted by approximately $2,000,000.

Item 8.	Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.
- ----------------------------------------------------
        Financial statements, supplementary financial information
and Accountant's Report are filed with this report.  (See
Financial Statements and reports thereon of Simontacchi and
Company, LLP for 2006 and R.A. Fredericks and Company, LLP for
2005.)  The index to our Financial Statements is found on page

	None.

Item 9A.	Controls and Procedures.
- ---------------------------------
        Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by
this report.  Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of September 30, 2006.  Management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is in the process
of evaluating the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 based on the framework in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

19
 
 Based on preliminary results to date, management has not
identified any material weaknesses in internal control over
financial reporting as of October 1, 2006.  No change in our
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fourth
quarter of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2006 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
        Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B.	Other Information
- ---------------------------
        On October 20, 2004, the Registrant filed an amendment to the
Restated Certificate of Incorporation for the purpose of reducing
the number of Authorized Common Shares to 272,000 from 2,000,000.
        The amendment was duly adopted in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Sections 242 and 228 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and was approved by the
affirmative vote of approximately 81% of the Registrant's
shareholders.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders'
Holobeam, Inc.
Ho Ho Kus, NJ

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Holobeam, Inc.
as of September 30, 2006 and the related statement of operations,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year ended September
30, 2006.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Holobeam, Inc. as of September 30, 2006 and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30,
2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Further, it is our opinion that
the schedules referred to in the accompanying index present
fairly the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, 2005 AND 2004

NOTE 1.   SUMMARY OF MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES

               a.  Description of Business

              The Company is engaged primarily in the rental of
              real property located in New Jersey for retail
              use.

               b   Basis of Presentation

               The financial statements are prepared in
              accordance with accounting principles generally
              accepted in the United States of America and
              include amounts based on management's prudent
              judgements and estimates. While actual results may
              differ from these estimates, management does not
              expect the differences, if any, to have a material
              effect on the financial statements.

              c.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

              For purposes of reporting cash flows, all liquid
              investments with original maturities of three
              months or less are considered cash equivalents.

              d.  Property and Equipment

              Depreciation is provided on a straight-line and
              accelerated basis in amounts sufficient to write-
              off the cost of the assets over their estimated
              useful lives, which are as follows:

                Building and Building Improvements 31. 5 to 40 years
                Machinery and Equipment             5 to 7 years
                Furniture and Fixtures             7 to 10 years

              Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations
              in the year in which incurred, while replacements
              and betterments are capitalized by charges to the
              appropriate asset accounts.  The cost and
              accumulated depreciation and amortization with
              respect to assets retired or otherwise disposed,
              are eliminated from the assets and related
              accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts
              and any profit or loss resulting therefrom is
              reflected in operations.

              Patent and patent application costs are amortized
              on a straight-line basis over a ten year period.

              e.  Earnings Per Share

              Earnings per share of common stock has been
              computed by dividing net income by the weighted
              average number of common shares outstanding during
              the year.  Diluted earnings per share of common
              stock is the same as earnings per share prior to
              dilution.

NOTE 1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

              f.  Capital Stock

              Each share of common stock is entitled to one
              vote.  No such shares of common stock were
              reserved at September 30, 2006, 2005, or 2004.  On
              October 20, 2004, the Company amended its
              Certificate of Incorporation in order to reduce
              its authorized shares from 2,000,000 to 272,000.
              The Company purchased 1,125 shares during the year
              ended September 30, 2006 and retired 1,550 shares
              during the same period.  For the year ended
              September 30, 2005, the Company retired 1,000
              shares of Treasury Stock purchased on October 1,
              2004. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the
              Company retired 3,806 shares of Treasury Stock
              purchased at a cost of $89,492.

              g.  Income Taxes

              The Company provides for federal and state income
              taxes on items included in the Statements of
              Operations regardless of the period when such
              taxes are payable. Deferred taxes are recognized
              for temporary differences between financial and
              income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and
              rates.

              h.  Deferred Charges

              It is the policy of the Company to charge costs
              associated with the acquisition of long term debt
              (mortgages) to expense over the term of the
              mortgage.

              In addition, the Company charges costs associated
              with the procurement of operating leases,
              specifically real estate brokers commissions, to
              expense during the term of the operating lease.

              i.  Revenue Recognition

              Base rental revenue is recognized on a straight-
              line basis over the terms of the respective
              leases.  Unbilled rents receivable represents the
              amount by which straight-line rental revenue
              exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with
              the lease agreements.

          Management believes it is more likely than not that the
          long-term deferred tax asset will reduce future income
          tax payments. Significant factors considered by
          management in its determination of the probability of
          the realization of the deferred tax benefits include:
          (a) historical operating results; (b) expectations of
          future earnings and (c) the period of time over which
          the pension liabilities will be paid.

          106 " Employers Accounting for Post Retirement Benefits",
          and SFAS No. 112 "Employers Accounting for Post Employment
          Benefits", which changed employers' accounting for these
          benefits.  Since the Company has no post-retirement
          benefit plans, and does not offer post employment
          benefits, SFAS No. 106 and SFAS No. 112 are not
          applicable.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board
          issued SFAS No. 132  "Employers' Disclosures about
          Pensions and Other Post Retirement Benefits."  SFAS No.
          132 is not applicable for post employment benefits, but is

NOTE 9.   CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

          Substantially all of the Company's income is rental income
          received from two tenants.  These tenants are subject to
          long-term lease agreements (See Note 3).

          The Company is also subject to concentrations of credit
          risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents which the
          Company attempts to minimize by entering into arrangements
          with major banks and financial institutions and investing
          in high-quality instruments. The Company does not expect
          any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

NOTE 11.      FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

          The Company has a number of financial instruments, none of
          which are held for trading purposes.  The Company
          estimates that the fair value of all financial instruments
          at September 30, 2006, does not differ materially from the
          aggregate carrying values of its financial instruments
          recorded in the accompanying balance sheet.  The estimated
          fair value amounts have been determined by the Company
          using available market information and appropriate
          valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgement is
          necessarily required in interpreting market data to
          develop the estimates of fair value, and accordingly, the
          estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
          that the Company could realize in a current market
          exchange.

NOTE 12.  PENSION PLAN

          The Company established a defined benefit plan covering
          all eligible employees, who have completed one year of
          service.  Benefits are based on years of service and the
          average compensation during the best three years of
          participation.

          The Company's funding policy is to make annual
          contributions to the plan in amounts such that all
          employees' benefits will be fully provided for by the time
          they retire.  Contributions are intended to provide not
          only for benefits attributed to service to date but also
          for those expected to be earned in the future.

          Although it has not expressed any intention to do so, the
          Company has the right under the plan to discontinue its
          contributions at any time and to terminate the Plan
          subject to the provisions set forth in ERISA.

          The Company has adopted SFAS No. 132 "Employers'
          Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post Retirement
          Benefits".  The provisions of SFAS No. 132 revise
          employers' disclosures about pension and other post
          retirement benefit plans.  It does not change the
          measurement or recognition of this plan.  It standardizes
          the disclosure requirements for pensions and other post
          retirement benefits to the extent practicable.

          The Company provides defined benefit pension plan to the
          employees.  The following provides a reconciliation of
          benefit obligations, plan assets, and funded status of the
          plan.

CERTIFICATIONS

        (a)	The Registrant maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that provide reasonable assurance that the Registrant is
able to record, process and summarize and report the information
required to comply with the Registrant's Exchange Act disclosure
obligations and for the Registrant's own internal purposes. The
Registrant has evaluated these controls and procedures at September
30, 2006 and has determined the controls and procedures to be
effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting the
information required by the Registrant's quarterly and annual
Exchange Act reports.

        (b)	There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's procedures or internal controls or in other factors
that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to
September 30, 2006, including corrective actions with regard to
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.  As of September
30, 2006, the examination of controls and procedures did not
disclose any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.

I, Ralph A. Fredericks, certify that:

        1.	I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of
Holobeam, Inc.;

        2.	Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of
the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading with respect to the period covered by this annual
report;

        3.	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and
other financial information included in this annual report, fairly
present in all material respects the financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the
periods presented in this annual report;

        4.	The Registrant's other certifying officers and I are
responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14)
for the Registrant and have:

        (a)	designed such disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that material information relating to the Registrant,
including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by
others within those entities, particularly during the period in
which this annual report is being prepared;

        (b)	designed such internal control over financial reporting,
or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

        (c)	evaluated the effectiveness of the Registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days
prior to the filing date of this annual report (the "Evaluation
Date"); and

(d)	presented in this annual report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on
our evaluation as of the Evaluation Date;

5.	The Registrant's other certifying officers and I have
disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation, to the Registrant's
auditors and the audit committee of Registrant's board of directors
(or persons performing the equivalent function):

a)	all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect the Registrant's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
have identified for the Registrant's auditors any material
weaknesses in internal controls; and

        b)	any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Registrant's internal controls.
