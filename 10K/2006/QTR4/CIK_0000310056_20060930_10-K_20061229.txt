PART I
                                     ------
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
- -----------------

General
- -------

Vicon  Industries,   Inc.  ("the  Company"),   incorporated  in  1967,  designs,
manufactures,  assembles  and  markets a wide range of video  systems and system
components  used for security,  surveillance,  safety and control  purposes by a
broad group of end users. A video system is generally a private network that can
transmit  and  receive  video,  audio and data  signals in  accordance  with the
operational  needs of the user.  The  Company's  primary  business  focus is the
design of digital video systems that it produces and sells worldwide,  primarily
to installing dealers, system integrators, government entities and distributors.

The Company  operates within the electronic  protection  segment of the security
industry which includes,  among others:  fire and burglar alarm systems,  access
control,  biometric and video systems and asset  protection.  The U.S.  security
industry  consists of thousands of  individuals  and  businesses  (exclusive  of
public  sector law  enforcement)  that  provide  products  and  services for the
protection  and  monitoring  of life,  property  and  information.  The security
industry includes fire and burglar alarm systems, access control, video systems,
asset protection,  guard services and equipment, locks, safes, armored vehicles,
security fencing,  private  investigations,  biometric  systems and others.  The
Company's   products   are   typically   used  for  crime   deterrence,   visual
documentation, observation of inaccessible or hazardous areas, enhancing safety,
managing liability,  obtaining cost savings (such as lower insurance  premiums),
managing  control  systems and improving the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of
personnel.  The Company's products are used in, among others,  office buildings,
manufacturing plants, apartment complexes, retail stores, government facilities,
airports,  transportation  operations,  prisons, casinos, hotels, sports arenas,
health care facilities and financial institutions.

Products
- --------

The  Company's  product  line  consists of various  elements of a video  system,
including network video encoders, decoders, servers and related video management
software,  analog and IP cameras,  digital recorders,  display units (monitors),
matrix switchers,  robotic camera dome systems and system controls.  The Company
provides a  comprehensive  line of products due to the many varied  climatic and
operational  environments  in which the  products  are  expected to perform.  In
addition to selling from a standard  catalog line, the Company at times produces
to   specification   or  will  modify  an  existing  product  to  meet  customer
requirements.

The  Company's  products  range in price from $10 for a simple  camera  mounting
bracket to several hundred thousand dollars (depending upon configuration) for a
large  digital  control,  transmission,  recording,  storage  and  video  matrix
switching  system.  The Company's sales are concentrated  principally  among its
digital video systems and dome camera systems product lines.

- 2 -

Marketing
- ---------

The Company's  marketing  emphasizes  engineered  video system  solutions  which
includes system design, project management,  technical training and pre and post
sales support.  The Company  promotes and markets its products  through industry
trade shows worldwide,  product  brochures and catalogues,  direct marketing and
electronic mailings to existing and prospective  customers,  website promotions,
in-house training seminars for customers and end users, road shows which preview
new systems and system  components,  and advertising  through trade and end user
magazines  and  the  Company's  web  site  (www.vicon-cctv.com).  The  Company's
products  are  sold  principally  to  over  1,000  independent  dealers,  system
integrators  and  distributors.  Sales  are  made  principally  by  field  sales
engineers and inside  customer  service  representatives.  The  Company's  sales
effort is supported by in-house  customer  service  coordinators  and  technical
support  groups which  provide  product  information,  application  engineering,
design detail,  field project  management,  and hardware and software  technical
support.

The  Company's  products  are  employed in video  system  installations  by: (1)
commercial and industrial users, such as office buildings, manufacturing plants,
warehouses,  apartment complexes, shopping malls and retail stores; (2) federal,
state,  and  local  governments  for  national  security   purposes,   municipal
facilities,  prisons, and military  installations;  (3) financial  institutions,
such as banks, clearing houses,  brokerage firms and depositories,  for security
purposes; (4) transportation departments for highway traffic control, bridge and
tunnel   monitoring,   and  airport,   subway,  bus  and  seaport  security  and
surveillance;  (5) gaming casinos, where video surveillance is often mandated by
regulatory  authorities;  and (6) health  care  facilities,  such as  hospitals,
particularly psychiatric wards and intensive care units.

The  Company's  principal  sales  offices  are located in  Hauppauge,  New York;
Fareham, England; Zaventem, Belgium; and Neumunster, Germany.

International Sales
- -------------------

The  Company  sells its  products  in Europe,  Scandinavia  and the Middle  East
through its European-based subsidiary and elsewhere outside the U.S. principally
by direct  export from its U.S.  based  parent  company.  In October  2004,  the
Company acquired all of the operating assets of Videotronic  Infosystems GmbH, a
30-year old Germany based video system supplier, to expand its presence into the
sizable  German  video  security  market.  The  Company  has a  few  territorial
exclusivity  agreements  with  customers  but  primarily  uses a wide  range  of
installation  companies and distributors in international markets. In Australia,
Japan and Norway, the Company permits  independent sales  representatives to use
the Company's name for marketing purposes.

Direct export sales and sales from the Company's foreign  subsidiaries  amounted
to $26.0  million,  $27.0  million  and  $22.3  million  or 46%,  48% and 42% of
consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004,  respectively.  The
Company's  principal foreign markets are Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific
Rim, which together  accounted for approximately  89% of international  sales in
fiscal 2006.

                                      - 3 -
 
Competition
- -----------

The Company operates in a highly  competitive  marketplace both domestically and
internationally.  The Company  competes by providing  high-end video systems and
system components that incorporate broad capability together with high levels of
customer service and technical support.  Generally, the Company does not compete
based on price alone.

The  Company's  principal  engineered  video  systems  competitors  include  the
following companies or their affiliates:  Matsushita Electric Corp. (Panasonic),
Pelco Sales Company, Bosch Security Systems, Inc., Sensormatic Electronics Corp.
(a division of Tyco  International),  GE Security Systems and Honeywell Security
Systems.  Many additional  companies,  both domestic and international,  produce
products that compete against one or more of the Company's system components. In
addition,   many  consumer  video  electronic  companies  or  their  affiliates,
including   Matsushita   Electric   Corp.   (Panasonic),   Mitsubishi   Electric
Corporation,  Sanyo  Electric Co., Ltd. and Sony  Corporation,  compete with the
Company for the sale of video products and systems.  Almost all of the Company's
principal  competitors are larger companies whose financial  resources and scope
of operations are substantially greater than the Company's.

Engineering and Development
- ---------------------------

The Company's  engineering  and development is focused on new and improved video
systems and system components. In recent years, the trend of product development
and demand within the video security and surveillance market has been toward the
application  of digital  technology,  principally  relating to the  compression,
analysis,  transmission,  storage, manipulation,  imaging and display of digital
video over IP networks.  As the demands of the Company's  target market  segment
require the  Company to keep pace with  changes in  technology,  the Company has
focused its engineering effort in these developing areas.  Development  projects
are chosen and  prioritized  based on direct  customer  feedback,  the Company's
analysis as to the needs of the marketplace,  anticipated technological advances
and market research.

At  September  30,  2006,  the Company  employed a total of 41  engineers in the
following areas: software development, mechanical design,  manufacturing/testing
and electrical and circuit design.  Engineering and development expense amounted
to  approximately  8% of net sales in fiscal 2006 and 9% of net sales in each of
fiscal years 2005 and 2004.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials
- ----------------------------------------

The Company relies upon independent  manufacturers  and suppliers to manufacture
and assemble certain of its proprietary products and expects to continue to rely
on such entities in the future. The Company's  relationships with certain of its
independent  manufacturers,  assemblers  and suppliers are not covered by formal
contractual agreements.

Raw  materials  and  components  purchased by the Company and its  suppliers are
generally readily  available in the market,  subject to market lead times at the
time of order.  The  Company  is not  dependent  upon any  single  source  for a
significant amount of its raw materials or components.

                                      - 4 -
 
Intellectual Property
- ---------------------

The  Company  owns,  and has  pending,  a limited  number of design and  utility
patents  expiring at various  times.  The Company  owns certain  trademarks  and
several other trademark  applications  are pending both in the United States and
in Europe. Most of the Company's key products employ proprietary  software which
is protected by copyright.  The Company  considers  its software  products to be
unique  and is a  principal  element  in the  differentiation  of the  Company's
products from its competition. However, the laws of certain foreign countries do
not  protect  intellectual  property  rights  to the same  extent or in the same
manner  as the  laws  of the  U.S.  The  Company  has no  significant  licenses,
franchises  or  concessions  with  respect to any of its  products  or  business
dealings.  In  addition,  the Company  does not  believe  its limited  number of
patents or its lack of licenses, franchises and concessions to be of substantial
significance.  However, the Company is a defendant in a patent infringement suit
as  discussed  in "Item 3 - Legal  Proceedings",  the  outcome  of  which  could
possibly have a material effect on the Company's business.

Inventories
- -----------

The Company generally  maintains  sufficient  finished goods inventory levels to
respond to  unanticipated  customer  demand,  since most sales are to installing
dealers and contractors who normally do not carry any significant inventory. The
Company principally builds inventory to known or anticipated customer demand. In
addition to normal safety stock levels,  certain additional inventory levels may
be maintained for products with long purchase and manufacturing  lead times. The
Company  believes  that it is important to carry  adequate  inventory  levels of
parts,  components  and products to avoid  production  and delivery  delays that
detract from its sales effort.

Backlog
- -------

The backlog of orders  believed to be firm as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 was
approximately $7.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively.  Orders are generally
cancelable  without  penalty at the option of the customer.  The Company prefers
that its  backlog of orders not exceed its  ability to fulfill  such orders on a
timely basis, since experience shows that long delivery schedules only encourage
the Company's customers to look elsewhere for product availability.

Employees
- ---------

At September 30, 2006, the Company employed 208 full-time  employees,  of whom 8
are officers,  44 are in  administration,  83 are in sales and technical service
capacities,  41 are in engineering and 32 are production employees. At September
30, 2005, the Company employed 218 persons.  There are no collective  bargaining
agreements  with any of the Company's  employees  and the Company  considers its
relations with its employees to be good.

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS
- ----------------------

The Company designs,  manufactures and markets a wide range of video systems and
components  worldwide  and  is  subject  to  all  business  risks  that  similar
technology  companies  and all other  companies  encounter in their  operations.
Market risks that pertain particularly to the Company are discussed elsewhere in
this Form 10-K under Item 1 -  Business;  Item 3 - Legal  Proceedings;  Item 7 -
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations;  and Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk.

ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
- -----------------------------------

None.

- 5 -
 
ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES
- -------------------

The Company principally  operates from an 80,000 square-foot facility located at
89 Arkay  Drive,  Hauppauge,  New York,  which it owns.  The Company also owns a
14,000  square-foot  sales,  service and warehouse  facility in southern England
which  services the U.K.,  Europe and the Middle East. In addition,  the Company
operates under leases from offices in Yavne,  Israel;  Neumunster,  Germany; and
various local sales offices  throughout  Europe.  The Company  believes that its
facilities are adequate to meet its current and foreseeable operating needs.

ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
- --------------------------

The Company is one of several defendants in a patent infringement suit commenced
by Lectrolarm  Custom  Systems,  Inc. in May 2003 in the United States  District
Court for the Western  District of Tennessee.  The alleged  infringement  by the
Company  relates to its camera dome systems and other  products  that  represent
significant  sales to the Company.  Among other things,  the suit seeks past and
enhanced  damages,  injunctive  relief and attorney's fees. In January 2006, the
Company  received the plaintiff's  claim for past damages  through  December 31,
2005 that approximated $11.7 million plus pre-judgment interest. The Company and
its outside  patent  counsel  believe that the complaint  against the Company is
without merit.  The Company is vigorously  defending  itself and is a party to a
joint  defense with  certain  other named  defendants.  The Company is unable to
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any, at this time. Although the
Company  believes that it has  meritorious  defenses to such claims,  there is a
possibility that an unfavorable outcome could ultimately occur that could result
in a liability  that is  material to the  Company's  results of  operations  and
financial  position.  The Company has held discussions with the plaintiff in the
interest of  settling  the case.  However,  there can be no  assurance  that any
settlement can be reached.

In  connection  with this  suit,  the  Company  petitioned  the U.S.  Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) for  reexamination of the plaintiff's  patent. In April
2006,  the  USPTO  issued  a  non-final  office  action  rejecting  all  of  the
plaintiff's  patent claims asserted  against the Company citing the existence of
prior art of the Company and another  defendant.  The plaintiff has appealed the
USPTO  ruling and has  additional  appeals  available  to them in the USPTO and,
thereafter,  in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  On June 30, 2006,
the Federal  District  Court  granted  the  defendants'  motion for  continuance
(delay) of the trial,  pending the outcome of the USPTO's  reexamination  office
proceedings.

The last sale  price of the  Company's  Common  Stock on  December  15,  2006 as
reported  on AMEX was $3.59 per  share.  As of  December  15,  2006,  there were
approximately 200 shareholders of record.

The Company has never  declared or paid cash  dividends  on its Common Stock and
anticipates  that any  earnings  in the  foreseeable  future will be retained to
finance the growth and development of its business.

On April 26, 2001, the Company announced that its Board of Directors  authorized
the  repurchase  of up to $1 million of shares of the  Company's  common  stock,
which represented  approximately  9.8% of shares outstanding on the announcement
date.  The Company did not  repurchase  any of its common stock during the three
month period ended September 30, 2006.

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     OF OPERATIONS
     -------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

Fiscal Year 2006 Compared with 2005
- -----------------------------------

Net sales for 2006  increased  slightly  to $56.3  million  compared  with $56.1
million in 2005.  Domestic  sales  increased 4% to $30.3  million  compared with
$29.1  million  in 2005.  International  sales  decreased  4% to  $26.0  million
compared  with $27.0  million in 2005.  The backlog of unfilled  orders was $7.2
million at September 30, 2006 compared with $6.7 million at September 30, 2005.

Gross profit margins for 2006 increased to 39.3% compared with 37.5% in 2005 due
principally to production  cost  reductions  within the Company's  digital video
product line and a favorable product sales mix.

Operating  expenses for 2006  decreased  to $22.5  million or 39.9% of net sales
compared  with  $23.9  million or 42.7% of net sales in 2005 as a result of cost
reduction initiatives spread among all operating expense categories. In 2006 and
2005, the Company incurred $537,000 and $661,000, respectively, of legal expense
in the defense of a patent  infringement  suit ($1.9 million since  inception in
2003). In addition,  the Company continued to invest in new product development,
incurring $4.5 million of engineering and development  expenses in 2006 compared
with $4.8 million in 2005.

The Company  incurred an operating loss of $367,000 in 2006 compared with a loss
of $2.9 million in 2005. The $2.6 million  improvement in operating  performance
in 2006 was due  principally  to  improved  gross  margins  and lower  operating
expenses.  The current year results  include a $525,000  operating loss from the
Company's  Videotronic  subsidiary  compared with a $357,000 loss in 2005. Since
its  acquisition  on October 1, 2004,  this  subsidiary  has incurred  operating
losses as it continued to transition from former bankruptcy protection.

Interest  expense  decreased to $165,000 for 2006 compared with $181,000 in 2005
principally as a result of the paydown of bank  borrowings  offset,  in part, by
the effect of increased  interest  rates during 2006.  Interest and other income
increased to $136,000 for 2006  compared with $88,000 in 2005  principally  as a
result of increased  interest  rates during the current year.  During 2005,  the
Company also  liquidated  the principal  portion of its investment in marketable
securities, resulting in a $45,000 loss for the year.

Income tax expense for 2006 was $150,000  compared with $27,000 in 2005 relating
principally to profits  reported by the Company's U.K.  subsidiary.  The Company
has ceased  recognizing  tax  benefits on its U.S.  operating  losses due to the
uncertainty of their future realization.

An extraordinary gain in the amount of $211,000 was recorded in 2005 relating to
the Company's acquisition of its Videotronic subsidiary. The gain represents the
recovery of tangible net assets acquired in excess of their purchase price.

As a result of the  foregoing,  the  Company  incurred a net loss of $547,000 in
2006 compared with a net loss of $2.9 million in 2005.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                      ------------------------------------

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

Fiscal Year 2005 Compared with 2004
- -----------------------------------

Net sales for 2005 increased 5% to $56.1 million  compared with $53.5 million in
2004.  Net sales for 2005  included  $6.2  million of sales  from the  Company's
German subsidiary,  Videotronic, whose operating assets were acquired on October
1, 2004.  Domestic  sales  decreased  7% to $29.1  million  compared  with $31.2
million  in 2004.  International  sales,  excluding  the  Company's  Videotronic
subsidiary,  decreased 7% to $20.8 million  compared with $22.3 million in 2004.
The backlog of unfilled  orders was $6.7 million at September  30, 2005 compared
with $4.7 million at September 30, 2004.

Gross profit  margins for 2005  increased to 37.5%  compared with 36.8% in 2004.
The 2004 margin was  negatively  impacted by $1.1 million  (2.1%) of charges for
the phase out of certain  discontinued  product lines.  Excluding the effects of
these year ago period charges,  the Company's 2005 margins  declined as a result
of reduced selling prices on its digital video server/recorder product line.

Operating  expenses for 2005  increased  to $23.9  million or 42.7% of net sales
compared with $21.9 million or 41.0% of net sales in 2004. The increase included
$2.3  million  of  operating  expenses  incurred  by the  Company's  Videotronic
subsidiary.  In 2005 and 2004,  the  Company  incurred  $661,000  and  $562,000,
respectively,  of legal  expense in the  defense of a patent  infringement  suit
($1.3 million since  inception in 2003). In addition,  the Company  continued to
invest in new product development in 2005, incurring $4.8 million of engineering
and development expenses compared with $4.9 million in 2004.

The Company  incurred an operating  loss of $2.9 million in 2005 compared with a
loss of $2.2  million  in 2004.  The  current  year  results  include a $357,000
operating loss from the Company's Videotronic subsidiary as it transitioned from
former bankruptcy protection.

Interest  expense  decreased to $181,000 for 2005 compared with $187,000 in 2004
principally as a result of the paydown of bank  borrowings  offset,  in part, by
the effect of increased  interest  rates during 2005.  Interest and other income
decreased to $88,000 for 2005 compared with  $204,000 in 2004  principally  as a
result of reduced  investable  funds during the current year.  During 2005,  the
Company also  liquidated  the principal  portion of its investment in marketable
securities, resulting in a $45,000 loss for the year.

Income tax expense for 2005 was $27,000  compared with $481,000 in 2004 relating
principally to profits reported by the Company's European operation. The Company
has ceased  recognizing  tax  benefits on its U.S.  operating  losses due to the
uncertainty of its future realization.

An extraordinary gain in the amount of $211,000 was recorded in 2005 relating to
the Company's acquisition of its Videotronic subsidiary. The gain represents the
recovery of tangible net assets  acquired in excess of the purchase price of the
assets.

As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred a net loss of $2.9 million in
2005 compared with a net loss of $2.7 million in 2004.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                      ------------------------------------

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -------------------------------

Net cash provided by operating activities was $722,000 for 2006. The net loss of
$547,000 for the year was more than offset by $1.1 million of non-cash  charges.
Increases in accounts  receivable  of $872,000 and  inventories  of $1.4 million
were offset in part by an increase in accounts payable of $1.6 million. Net cash
used in investing  activities was $516,000 for 2006 due  principally to $510,000
of general  capital  expenditures.  Net cash used in  financing  activities  was
$396,000 in 2006,  which  included  $403,000  of  scheduled  repayments  of bank
mortgage  loans.  As a result of the  foregoing,  cash decreased by $179,000 for
2006 after the effect of  exchange  rate  changes  on the cash  position  of the
Company.

The Company's European-based subsidiary maintains a bank overdraft facility that
provides for maximum  borrowings of one million Pounds  Sterling  (approximately
$1,870,000)  to support its local working  capital  requirements.  This facility
expires in March 2007. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, there were no outstanding
borrowings under this facility.

The  following  is a  summary  of the  Company's  long-term  debt  and  material
operating lease obligations as of September 30, 2006:

              Debt                 Lease
Year       Repayments           Commitments         Total
- ----       ----------           -----------         -----
2007       $  332,000             $379,000       $  711,000
2008        1,740,000              119,000        1,859,000
2009            -                   19,000           19,000

The Company has incurred  operating  losses in recent years which, if continued,
could  exhaust  the  Company's  cash  reserves  and limit its  ability to secure
additional bank financing,  if needed.  The Company has instituted certain plans
to preserve its cash. The Company  believes that it will have sufficient cash to
meet its anticipated  operating  costs,  capital  expenditures  and debt service
requirements for at least the next twelve months.

The Company does not have any off-balance  sheet  transactions,  arrangements or
obligations  (including  contingent  obligations)  that have, or are  reasonably
likely to have, a material effect on the Company's financial condition,  results
of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

The Company is one of several defendants in a patent infringement suit commenced
by Lectrolarm  Custom  Systems,  Inc. in May 2003 in the United States  District
Court for the Western  District of Tennessee.  The alleged  infringement  by the
Company  relates to its camera dome systems and other  products  that  represent
significant  sales to the Company.  Among other things,  the suit seeks past and
enhanced  damages,  injunctive  relief and attorney's fees. In January 2006, the
Company  received the plaintiff's  claim for past damages  through  December 31,
2005 that approximated $11.7 million plus pre-judgment interest. The Company and
its outside  patent  counsel  believe that the complaint  against the Company is
without merit.  The Company is vigorously  defending  itself and is a party to a
joint  defense with  certain  other named  defendants.  The Company is unable to
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any, at this time. Although the
Company  believes that it has  meritorious  defenses to such claims,  there is a
possibility that an unfavorable outcome could ultimately occur that could result
in a liability  that is  material to the  Company's  results of  operations  and
financial  position.  The Company has held discussions with the plaintiff in the
interest of  settling  the case.  However,  there can be no  assurance  that any
settlement can be reached.

In  connection  with this  suit,  the  Company  petitioned  the U.S.  Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) for  reexamination of the plaintiff's  patent. In April
2006,  the  USPTO  issued  a  non-final  office  action  rejecting  all  of  the
plaintiff's  patent claims asserted  against the Company citing the existence of
prior art of the Company

                                     - 10 -

and another  defendant.  The  plaintiff  has  appealed  the USPTO ruling and has
additional appeals available to them in the USPTO and, thereafter,  in the Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June 30, 2006, the Federal District Court
granted the defendants' motion for continuance (delay) of the trial, pending the
outcome of the USPTO's reexamination office proceedings.

Critical Accounting Policies
- ----------------------------

The Company's  significant  accounting policies are fully described in Note 1 to
the consolidated  financial  statements included in Part IV. Management believes
the  following  critical  accounting  policies,  among  others,  affect its more
significant  judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements.

The Company  recognizes  revenue  when  persuasive  evidence  of an  arrangement
exists,  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price
is fixed or  determinable,  and  collectibility  of the resulting  receivable is
reasonably  assured.  As it  relates  to product  sales,  revenue  is  generally
recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer.  Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Advance service billings under
a national  supply  contract  with one customer are deferred and  recognized  as
revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement. Pursuant to
the  adoption  of EITF Issue No.  00-21,  "Revenue  Arrangements  with  Multiple
Deliverables",  the Company evaluates  multiple-element revenue arrangements for
separate  units of  accounting,  and  follows  appropriate  revenue  recognition
policies for each  separate  unit.  Elements are  considered  separate  units of
accounting  provided that (i) the delivered  item has  stand-alone  value to the
customer, (ii) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the
delivered  item,  and (iii) if a general right of return exists  relative to the
delivered item,  delivery or performance of the  undelivered  item is considered
probable and substantially  within the control of the Company. As applied to the
Company,  under arrangements  involving the sale of product and the provision of
services, product sales are recognized as revenue when the products are sold and
title is passed to the customer,  and service  revenue is recognized as services
are performed.  For products that include more than incidental software, and for
separate licenses of the Company's  software  products,  the Company  recognizes
revenue in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  Statement  of  Position  97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition", as amended.

The Company  maintains  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.  If the
financial  condition  of its  customers  were to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an
impairment  of their  ability to make  payments,  additional  allowances  may be
required.

The Company  provides for the estimated  cost of product  warranties at the time
revenue is recognized. While the Company engages in product quality programs and
processes,  including  monitoring  and  evaluating  the quality of its component
suppliers,  its  warranty  obligation  is  affected  by product  failure  rates,
material  usage and service  delivery  costs  incurred in  correcting  a product
failure. Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery
costs differ from its estimates,  revisions to the estimated  warranty liability
may be required.

The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and slow moving
inventory equal to the difference between the carrying cost of inventory and the
estimated net realizable market value based upon assumptions about future demand
and market conditions.  Technology changes and market conditions may render some
of the Company's products obsolete and additional  inventory  write-downs may be
required.  If actual future demand or market  conditions are less favorable than
those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

                                     - 11 -

The Company assesses the  recoverability of the carrying value of its long-lived
assets,  including  identifiable  intangible  assets with finite  useful  lives,
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable.  The Company evaluates the  recoverability of
such assets based upon the  expectations  of  undiscounted  cash flows from such
assets. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than
the carrying  amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference
between the fair value and the carrying amount.

The  Company's  ability to recover the reported  amounts of deferred  income tax
assets is  dependent  upon its ability to  generate  sufficient  taxable  income
during the periods over which net temporary tax differences  become  deductible.
The Company plans to provide a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax
assets until such time that it can achieve a sustained level of profitability or
other positive evidence arises that would demonstrate an ability to recover such
assets.

The Company is subject to  proceedings,  lawsuits  and other  claims  related to
labor,  product and other  matters.  The Company  assesses the  likelihood of an
adverse  judgment  or  outcomes  for  these  matters,  as well as the  range  of
potential  losses.  A determination  of the reserves  required,  if any, is made
after careful  analysis.  The required  reserves may change in the future due to
new developments.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
- --------------------------------

In July 2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes --
an  interpretation  of FASB  Statement No. 109". FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for  uncertainty  in  income  taxes  recognized  in  an  enterprise's  financial
statements in accordance  with FASB  Statement  No. 109,  Accounting  for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition  threshold and measurement  attribute for
the financial  statement  recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected  to be  taken  in a tax  return.  FIN  48  also  provides  guidance  on
derecognition,  classification,  interest and  penalties,  accounting in interim
periods,  disclosures,  and  transition.  FIN 48 is  effective  for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption
of FIN 48 will have a material impact on its  consolidated  financial  position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In  September  2006,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  157,  "Fair Value  Measurements"
("SFAS  157").  SFAS 157  clarifies  that fair value is the amount that would be
exchanged  to sell an asset or  transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction
between market  participants.  Further, the standard establishes a framework for
measuring  fair value in generally  accepted  accounting  principles and expands
certain  disclosures  about fair value  measurements.  SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not expect that
the  adoption  of SFAS 157  will  have a  material  impact  on its  consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September  2006,  the U.S.  Securities and Exchange  Commission  issued Staff
Accounting   Bulletin   No.  108,   "Considering   the  Effects  of  Prior  Year
Misstatements   when   Quantifying   Misstatements  in  Current  Year  Financial
Statements"  ("SAB  108").  SAB 108  provides  interpretive  guidance on how the
effects of the  carryover  or  reversal  of prior year  misstatements  should be
considered in  quantifying a current year  misstatement.  The SEC staff believes
that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income
statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a
misstatement  that, when all relevant  quantitative and qualitative  factors are
considered,  is material.  SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SAB 108 will
have a  material  impact on its  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows.

                                     - 12 -
 
Foreign Currency Activity
- -------------------------

The  Company's  foreign  exchange   exposure  is  principally   limited  to  the
relationship of the U.S. dollar to the British pound sterling,  the Euro and the
Israeli shekel.

Sales by the Company's U.K. and German based subsidiaries to customers in Europe
are made in British pounds sterling (pounds) or Eurodollars  (Euros).  In fiscal
2006,  approximately  $5.8  million of products  were sold by the Company to its
U.K. based subsidiary for resale.  The Company attempts to minimize its currency
exposure  on  intercompany  sales  through  the  purchase  of  forward  exchange
contracts.

The Company's  Israeli based subsidiary  incurs shekel based operating  expenses
which are funded by the Company in U.S. dollars.  In past years, the Company had
purchased forward exchange  contracts to minimize its currency exposure on these
expenses during periods of favorable fluctuating exchange rates.

As of September 30, 2006, the Company had forward exchange contracts outstanding
with notional amounts aggregating $800,000.  The Company also attempts to reduce
the impact of an  unfavorable  exchange rate condition  through cost  reductions
from its suppliers and shifting  product  sourcing to suppliers  transacting  in
more stable and favorable currencies.

In general, the Company seeks lower costs from suppliers and enters into forward
exchange  contracts to mitigate  short-term  exchange rate  exposures.  However,
there  can be no  assurance  that  such  steps  will be  effective  in  limiting
long-term foreign currency exposure.

ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- --------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Risk Factors
- -------------------

The Company is exposed to various  market  risks,  including  changes in foreign
currency  exchange  rates and  interest  rates.  The  Company  has a policy that
prohibits the use of currency  derivatives or other  financial  instruments  for
trading or speculative purposes.

The Company  enters into forward  exchange  contracts to hedge  certain  foreign
currency  exposures  and  minimize the effect of such  fluctuations  on reported
earnings and cash flow (see  "Foreign  Currency  Activity",  Note 1  "Derivative
Instruments"  and "Fair  Value of  Financial  Instruments"  to the  accompanying
financial  statements).  At September 30, 2006, the Company's  foreign  currency
exchange  risks  included an  aggregate  $2.5  million of  intercompany  account
balances between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are short term and will
be  settled  in fiscal  2007.  The  following  sensitivity  analysis  assumes an
instantaneous  10%  change in foreign  currency  exchange  rates  from  year-end
levels, with all other variables held constant.

At  September  30,  2006, a 10%  strengthening  or weakening of the U.S.  dollar
versus the  British  pound  would  result in a $248,000  decrease  or  increase,
respectively,  in the intercompany accounts receivable balance.  Certain of such
foreign currency exchange risk at September 30, 2006 has been hedged by $800,000
of forward exchange contracts.

At September 30, 2006, the Company had $1.4 million of outstanding floating rate
bank debt which was covered by an interest rate swap agreement that  effectively
converts the  foregoing  floating rate debt to a stated fixed rate (see "Note 5.
Long-Term Debt" to the accompanying financial statements). Thus, the Company has
substantially no net interest rate exposures on these instruments.  However, the
Company had approximately $589,000 of floating rate bank debt that is subject to
interest rate risk as it was not covered by an interest rate swap agreement. The
Company does not believe that a 10%  fluctuation  in interest rates would have a
material  effect  on  its  consolidated   financial   position  and  results  of
operations.

Inflation
- ---------

The impact of  inflation  on the Company has been minimal in recent years as the
rate of inflation remains low. However, inflation continues to increase costs to
the Company.  As operating  expenses and production costs increase,  the Company
principally seeks to increase sales and lower its product cost where possible.

ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
- ---------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
- ------------------------------------------------

The Company's management,  with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Company's  disclosure  controls and  procedures,  as
required  by  Exchange  Act Rule  13a-15.  Based on that  evaluation,  the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end
of the period  covered by this report,  the  Company's  disclosure  controls and
procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports  that it files or submits  under the  Exchange Act is
recorded,  processed,  summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

- 14 -
 
Changes in Internal Controls
- ----------------------------

There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting
identified in  connection  with the  evaluation  referred to above that occurred
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2006 that have
materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

The Company's  size dictates that it conducts  business with a minimal number of
financial and  administrative  employees,  which inherently results in a lack of
documented  controls  and  segregation  of duties  within  the  Company  and its
operating  subsidiaries.  Management  will  continue to evaluate  the  employees
involved and the control  procedures in place,  the risks  associated  with such
lack of segregation  and whether the potential  benefits of adding  employees to
clearly  segregate  duties  justifies  the  expense  associated  with such added
personnel.  In addition,  management is aware that many of the internal controls
that are in place at the Company are undocumented controls.

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
- --------------------------------------------

The Company  believes  that a control  system,  no matter how well  designed and
operated,  cannot provide absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met, and no  evaluation  of controls can provide  absolute  assurance
that all control  issues and instances of fraud,  if any,  within a company have
been detected.

requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The agreement,  which
expires on  December  31,  2007,  provides  Mr.  Badke a lump sum payment in the
amount of three times his average  annual  compensation  for the  previous  five
years if there is a change in control of the Company  without  Board of Director

whereby  he will  receive  an  amount  equal  to  between  2% and 6%  (based  on

approximately  $35,300  based upon his  achievement  of certain sales and profit

of approximately  $190,000 (100,000 Pounds Sterling) under certain  occurrences.

In addition, a performance based bonus plan for fiscal year 2007 was established
for Mr. McGowan whereby he earns variable  compensation  upon achieving  certain
U.S. sales targets.  For the fiscal year 2006, the Committee  approved a $30,000
discretionary bonus for Mr. McGowan. The Company also granted Mr. McGowan 13,500
stock options at the closing price on October 25, 2006.

Directors' Compensation and Term

During the fiscal year ending September 30, 2006,  directors were compensated at
an annual rate of $16,000 for regular  Board  meetings and $1,000 per  committee

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
- -----------------------------------------------------------

The  Compensation  Committee  of the  Board of  Directors  consists  of  Messrs.
Maloney, Neumann,  Robertson and Roche, none of whom has ever been an officer of
the Company  except for Mr. Roche,  who served as Executive  Vice President from
August 1993 until his retirement in November 1999.

                       Board Compensation Committee Report
                       -----------------------------------

The Compensation  Committee's  compensation policies applicable to the Company's
officers  for 2006 were to pay a  competitive  market  price for the services of
such  officers,  taking  into  account  the overall  performance  and  financial
capabilities of the Company and the officer's individual level of performance.

Mr. Darby makes  recommendations  to the  Compensation  Committee as to the base
salary and  incentive  compensation  of all  officers  other than  himself.  The
Committee reviews these  recommendations  with Mr. Darby and, after such review,
determines  compensation.  In the case of Mr. Darby, the Compensation  Committee
makes its determination after direct negotiation with him. For each officer, the
committee's   determinations  are  based  on  its  conclusions  concerning  each
officer's performance and comparable  compensation levels for similarly situated
officers at  comparable  companies.  The  overall  level of  performance  of the
Company is taken into account but is not specifically related to the base salary
of these officers.  Also, the Company has established an incentive  compensation
plan for  certain  officers,  which  provides  for a  specified  bonus  upon the
Company's achievement of certain annual sales and/or profitability targets.

The Compensation  Committee  grants options to officers to link  compensation to
the  performance  of the Company.  Options are  exercisable in the future at the
fair market value at the time of grant,  so that an officer granted an option is
rewarded by the  increase in the price of the  Company's  stock.  The  committee
grants options to officers based on significant contributions of such officer to
the performance of the Company.  In addition,  in determining Mr. Darby's salary
and bonus for service as Chief Executive  Officer,  the committee  considers the
responsibility  assumed by him in  formulating,  implementing  and  managing the
operational and strategic objectives of the Company.

Other Matters - Form S-8 and S-2 Undertaking
- --------------------------------------------

For the purposes of complying  with the  amendments to the rules  governing Form
S-8 (effective  July 13, 1990) under the Securities Act of 1933, the undersigned
registrant hereby undertakes as follows, which undertaking shall be incorporated
by reference into registrant's  Registration Statements on Form S-8 Nos. 33-7892
(filed June 30, 1986),  33-34349 (filed April 1, 1990), 33-90038 (filed February
24, 1995),  333-30097 (filed June 26, 1997),  333-71410 (filed October 11, 2001)
and 333-116361  (filed June 10, 2004) and on Form S-2 No.  333-46841  (effective
May 1, 1998):

Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities  arising under the Securities Act of
1933 may be permitted to  directors,  officers  and  controlling  persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  or otherwise,  the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
of  1933  and is,  therefore,  unenforceable.  In the  event  that a  claim  for
indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
registrant  in the  successful  defense of any action,  suit or  proceeding)  is
asserted by such director,  officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being  registered,  the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its
counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,  submit to a court
of appropriate  jurisdiction the question whether such  indemnification by it is
against  public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
             -------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Vicon Industries, Inc.:

We  have  audited  the  accompanying   consolidated   balance  sheets  of  Vicon
Industries,  Inc. as of September 30, 2006 and 2005 and the related consolidated
statements of operations,  stockholders'  equity, and cash flows for each of the
three  years ended  September  30,  2006.  In  connection  with our audit of the
consolidated financial statements,  we also have audited the financial statement
schedule  as  listed  in Part IV,  item  15(a)(2)  for the  fiscal  years  ended
September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004. These consolidated  financial  statements and
financial   statement   schedule  are  the   responsibility  of  the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility is to express an opinion on these  consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements  and schedule are free of material  misstatement.  The Company is not
required  to have,  nor were we engaged  to  perform,  an audit of its  internal
control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial  reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's  internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining,
on a  test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in the
financial  statements  and  schedule.  An  audit  also  includes  assessing  the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation  and schedule.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Vicon Industries,
Inc. at September 30, 2006 and 2005,  and the results of its  operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  September  30, 2006,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

Also, in our opinion,  the schedule presents fairly,  in all material  respects,
the information set forth therein.

VICON INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Fiscal Years ended September 30, 2006, 2005, and 2004

NOTE 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- ---------------------------------------------------

Nature of Business
- ------------------

The Company  designs,  manufactures,  assembles  and markets  video  systems and
system components for use in security, surveillance, safety and control purposes
by end users. The Company markets its products worldwide primarily to installing
dealers, systems integrators, government entities and distributors.

Basis of Presentation
- ---------------------

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vicon
Industries,  Inc.  (the  Company)  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries:  Vicon
Industries  Limited and subsidiary  (Videotronic  Infosystems GmbH) and TeleSite
U.S.A.,   Inc.  and  subsidiary  (Vicon  Systems  Ltd.),  after  elimination  of
intercompany accounts and transactions.

Revenue Recognition
- -------------------

The Company  recognizes  revenue  when  persuasive  evidence  of an  arrangement
exists,  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price
is fixed or  determinable,  and  collectibility  of the resulting  receivable is
reasonably  assured.  As it  relates  to product  sales,  revenue  is  generally
recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer.  Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of sales. Advance service billings under
a national  supply  contract  with one customer are deferred and  recognized  as
revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement. The Company
evaluates   multiple-element   revenue   arrangements   for  separate  units  of
accounting,  and  follows  appropriate  revenue  recognition  policies  for each
separate  unit.  Elements are considered  separate units of accounting  provided
that (i) the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, (ii) there is
objective  and reliable  evidence of the fair value of the delivered  item,  and
(iii) if a general  right of  return  exists  relative  to the  delivered  item,
delivery or  performance  of the  undelivered  item is  considered  probable and
substantially  within the  control of the  Company.  As applied to the  Company,
under arrangements  involving the sale of product and the provision of services,
product sales are  recognized as revenue when the products are sold and title is
passed to the  customer,  and service  revenue is  recognized  as  services  are
performed.  For products  that include more than  incidental  software,  and for
separate licenses of the Company's  software  products,  the Company  recognizes
revenue in  accordance  with the  provisions  of  Statement  of  Position  97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition", as amended.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit and amounts invested in highly
liquid money market funds.

Marketable Securities
- ---------------------

Marketable securities consist of mutual fund investments in U.S. government debt
securities.  Such  securities  are stated at market value and are  classified as
available-for-sale  under Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 115, with  unrealized  gains and
losses reported in other  comprehensive  income as a component of  shareholders'
equity.  The cost of such  securities was $129,373 and $123,881 at September 30,
2006 and  2005,  respectively,  with  $2,676  and  $2,051 of  unrealized  losses
included in the carrying amounts at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

- 37 -
 
Allowances for Doubtful Accounts
- --------------------------------

The Company  maintains  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  losses
resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.  If the
financial  condition  of its  customers  were to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an
impairment  of their  ability to make  payments,  additional  allowances  may be
required.

Inventories
- -----------

Inventories  are valued at the lower of cost (on a moving  average  basis  which
approximates a first-in, first-out method) or market. When it is determined that
a product or product  line will be sold below  carrying  cost,  affected on hand
inventories are written down to their estimated net realizable values.

Long-Lived Assets
- -----------------

Property,   plant,  and  equipment  are  recorded  at  cost.   Depreciation  and
amortization  of assets under capital leases,  is computed by the  straight-line
method  over the  estimated  useful  lives  of the  related  assets.  Machinery,
equipment and vehicles are being  depreciated  over periods ranging from 2 to 10
years. The Company's  buildings are being  depreciated over periods ranging from
25 to 40 years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their
estimated  useful lives or the remaining  lease term.  Fully  depreciated  fixed
assets are retired from the balance sheet when they are no longer in use.

The Company  reviews its  long-lived  assets for impairment  whenever  events or
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable.  If the sum of the expected  cash flows,  undiscounted  and without
interest,  is less than the carrying  amount of the asset, an impairment loss is
recognized  as the amount by which the carrying  amount of the asset exceeds its
fair value.

Engineering and Development
- ---------------------------

Product  engineering and  development  costs are charged to expense as incurred,
and amounted to  approximately  $4,500,000,  $4,800,000 and $4,900,000 in fiscal
2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share
- -------------------------

Basic EPS is computed  based on the  weighted  average  number of common  shares
outstanding.  Diluted EPS reflects the maximum dilution that would have resulted
from the exercise of stock options,  warrants and  incremental  shares  issuable
under a deferred  compensation  agreement  (see Note 10). In periods when losses
are incurred,  the effects of these securities are antidilutive and,  therefore,
are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS.

Foreign Currency Translation
- ----------------------------

The Company translates the financial  statements of its foreign  subsidiaries by
applying  the  current  rate  method  under  which  assets and  liabilities  are
translated  at the  exchange  rate on the balance  sheet date,  while  revenues,
costs,  and  expenses  are  translated  at the  average  exchange  rate  for the
reporting period. The resulting  cumulative  translation  adjustment of $998,000
and  $573,000 at  September  30, 2006 and 2005,  respectively,  is recorded as a
component of  shareholders'  equity in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income
(loss).

- 38 -
 
Income Taxes
- ------------

The Company  accounts  for income  taxes under the  provisions  of SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting  for Income  Taxes",  which  requires  recognition  of deferred  tax
liabilities and assets for the expected  future tax  consequences of events that
have been  included  in the  financial  statements  or tax  returns.  Under this
method,  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  are  determined  based  on the
difference  between  the  financial  statement  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and
liabilities  using  enacted  tax  rates in  effect  for the  year in  which  the
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred U.S. income taxes are not provided
on  undistributed  earnings of foreign  subsidiaries  as the  Company  presently
intends to reinvest such earnings  indefinitely,  and any plan to repatriate any
of  such  earnings  in the  future  is not  expected  to  result  in a  material
incremental  tax liability to the Company.  In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company
recognized  a  valuation  allowance  against its entire net  deferred  tax asset
balance due to the  uncertainty  of future  realization  (see Note 4 for further
discussion).

Product Warranties
- ------------------

The Company  provides for the estimated  cost of product  warranties at the time
revenue is recognized (see Note 3). While the Company engages in product quality
programs and processes,  including  monitoring and evaluating the quality of its
component  suppliers,  its warranty  obligation  is affected by product  failure
rates,  material  usage and service  delivery  costs  incurred in  correcting  a
product failure.  Should actual product failure rates, material usage or service
delivery  costs differ from its estimates,  revisions to the estimated  warranty
liability may be required.

Derivative Instruments
- ----------------------

SFAS No. 133,  "Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities",
establishes  accounting and reporting  standards for  derivative  instruments as
either assets or  liabilities  in the statement of financial  position  based on
their fair  values.  Changes in the fair  values are  required to be reported in
earnings or other  comprehensive  income  depending on the use of the derivative
and  whether it  qualifies  for hedge  accounting.  Derivative  instruments  are
designated  and  accounted  for as  either  a hedge  of a  recognized  asset  or
liability (fair value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted  transaction  (cash flow
hedge).  For  derivatives  designated as effective cash flow hedges,  changes in
fair values are recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair values
related to fair  value  hedges as well as the  ineffective  portion of cash flow
hedges are recognized in earnings.

The Company  does not use  derivative  instruments  for  speculative  or trading
purposes.  Derivative instruments are primarily used to manage exposures related
to  transactions  with the Company's  Europe and Israel based  subsidiaries  and
interest  rate risk on certain  variable rate bank  indebtedness.  To accomplish
this, the Company uses certain  contracts,  primarily  foreign  currency forward
contracts  ("forwards") and interest rate swaps,  which minimize cash flow risks
from  changes  in  foreign   currency   exchange   rates  and  interest   rates,
respectively.  These  derivatives  have been  designated as cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes.

As of  September  30, 2006,  the Company had an interest  rate swap and currency
forwards   outstanding  with  notional  amounts  aggregating  $1.4  million  and
$800,000,   respectively,   whose  aggregate  fair  value  was  a  liability  of
approximately  $22,000.  The  change in the fair value of these  derivatives  is
reflected  in  other  comprehensive  income  in the  accompanying  statement  of
shareholders' equity, net of tax where applicable.  The forwards have maturities
of less  than one  year and  require  the  Company  to  exchange  currencies  at
specified  dates and rates.  The interest  rate swap matures in the same amounts
and over the same periods as the related debt. The Company  considers the credit
risk related to the interest  rate swaps and the forwards to be low because such
instruments  are entered  into with  financial  institutions  having high credit
ratings and are generally settled on a net basis.  There were no gains or losses
recognized  in operations  due to hedge  ineffectiveness  during the  three-year
period ended  September  30, 2006.  The Company does not expect that the amounts
currently  classified in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income that will be
recognized in operations in the next fiscal year will be material.

                                     - 39 -

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
- -----------------------------------

The carrying amounts for trade accounts and other receivables, accounts payable
and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of
these instruments. The carrying amounts of the Company's long-term debt
instruments approximate fair value. The Company's interest rate swap agreement
is carried at its fair market value (which was a liability of approximately
$20,000 at September 30, 2006). This value represents the estimated amount the
Company would need to pay if such agreement was terminated before maturity,
principally resulting from market interest rate decreases. The fair value of the
Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts is estimated by obtaining
quoted market prices. The contracted exchange rates on committed forward
exchange contracts was approximately $2,000 less favorable than the market rates
for similar term contracts at September 30, 2006.

Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant
market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are
subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant
judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
- ---------------------------------------

Prior to October 1, 2005,  the  Company  followed  Accounting  Principles  Board
Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to Employees"  ("APB No. 25") and
related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock-based compensation.
Under APB No. 25,  compensation  expense was  recorded if, on the date of grant,
the market  price of the  underlying  stock  exceeded  its  exercise  price.  As
permitted by Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting
for Stock-Based  Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123") and SFAS No. 148 "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation  -  Transition  and  Disclosure - An Amendment of FASB
Statement  No. 123" ("SFAS No.  148"),  the Company had retained the  accounting
prescribed by APB No. 25 and presented the disclosure  information prescribed by
SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148.

Had  compensation  expense for stock option grants issued been determined  under
the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss and loss per share
(EPS) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005 and 2004 would have been:

2005            2004
                                                ----------       --------

Reported net loss                              $(2,884,621)    $(2,690,594)
Stock-based compensation cost, net of tax         (194,935)       (227,113)
                                               ------------    ------------
Pro forma net loss                             $(3,079,556)    $(2,917,707)
                                               ============    ============

Reported basic and diluted EPS                   $ (.63)        $  (.59)
Pro forma basic and diluted EPS                  $ (.67)        $  (.63)

Effective  October 1, 2005, the Company  adopted SFAS No.  123(R),  "Share-Based
Payment",  which requires that all share based payments to employees,  including
stock  options,  be  recognized  as  compensation  expense  in the  consolidated
financial  statements based on their fair values and over the requisite  service
period.  For the year ended  September 30, 2006, the Company  recorded  non-cash
compensation  expense of $152,413 ($.03 per basic and diluted share) relating to
stock  options.   The  Company  elected  to  utilize  the   modified-prospective
application  method,  whereby  compensation  expense is recorded  for all awards
granted  after  October 1, 2005 and for the unvested  portion of awards  granted
prior to this date.  Accordingly,  prior period  amounts have not been restated.
The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) resulted in an immaterial  cumulative  change in
accounting as of the date of adoption.

- 40 -

The fair value for options  granted during the fiscal years ended  September 30,
2006,  2005 and 2004 was  determined at the date of grant using a  Black-Scholes
valuation model and the straight-line  attribution  approach using the following
weighted average assumptions:

                                      2006            2005            2004
                                      ----            ----            ----

Risk-free interest rate                4.4%            3.8%            3.5%
Dividend yield                         0.0%            0.0%            0.0%
Volatility factor                     75.9%           62.2%           67.9%
Weighted average expected life       5 years         4 years         4 years

The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes  valuation method is based
on the implied yield currently available in U.S. Treasury securities at maturity
with an  equivalent  term.  The  Company has not  recently  declared or paid any
dividends  and  does  not  currently  expect  to do so in the  future.  Expected
volatility  is  based  on the  annualized  daily  historical  volatility  of the
Company's stock over a representative period. The weighted-average expected life
represents  the  period  over  which  stock-based  awards  are  expected  to  be
outstanding  and  was  determined  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including
historical  weighted  average and  projected  holding  periods for the remaining
unexercised  shares, the contractual terms of the Company's  stock-based awards,
vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior.

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded  options which have no vesting  restrictions  and are fully
transferable.  In addition,  option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective  assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility.  Because
the  Company's  employee  stock  options  have   characteristics   significantly
different  from traded  options,  and because  changes in the  subjective  input
assumptions  can  materially  affect the fair value  estimate,  in  management's
opinion,  the  existing  models do not  necessarily  provide a  reliable  single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

Use of Estimates
- ----------------

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities,  and  disclosure  of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements,  and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such
estimates  include,  but are not limited to,  provisions  for doubtful  accounts
receivable,  net realizable value of inventory,  warranty obligations,  deferred
tax valuation and assessments of the recoverability of the Company's  long-lived
assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications
- -----------------

Certain  prior year  amounts have been  reclassified  to conform to current year
presentation.

NOTE 2.  Short-Term Borrowings
- ------------------------------

The Company's European based subsidiary maintains a bank overdraft facility that
provides for maximum borrowings of one million Pounds Sterling  ($1,870,000) and
is secured by all the assets of the subsidiary.  This facility  expires in March
2007.  During fiscal 2006 and 2005,  there were no outstanding  borrowings under
this facility.

                                     - 41 -

NOTE 3.  Accrued Warranty Obligation

The Company maintains a valuation  allowance against its deferred tax assets due
to the uncertainty of future  realization.  The  establishment of such valuation
allowance  in 2003 was  determined  to be  appropriate  due to recent  operating
losses and the inherent  uncertainties of predicting future operating results in
periods over which such net tax  differences  become  deductible.  Deferred U.S.
income taxes are not provided on undistributed  earnings of foreign subsidiaries
as the Company presently intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely, and any
plan to repatriate  any of such earnings in the future is not expected to result
in a material incremental tax liability to the Company.

The Company  has  approximately  $6.9  million of U.S.  federal  income tax loss
carryforwards that expire in 2023 through 2026.

Pretax  domestic loss amounted to  approximately  $(189,000),  $(2,767,000)  and
$(3,856,000) in fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004,  respectively.  Pretax foreign
income (loss) amounted to approximately $(208,000),  $(91,000) and $1,646,000 in
fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In January 1998, the Company entered into an aggregate $2.9 million mortgage and
term  loan  agreement  with a bank to  finance  the  purchase  of its  principal
operating facility.  Such agreement included a $2,512,000 ten-year mortgage loan
payable in monthly  installments through January 2008, with a $1,188,000 payment
due at the end of the term. The mortgage loan bears interest at the bank's prime
rate minus 1.35% (6.90% and 5.40% at September 30, 2006 and 2005,  respectively)
and is secured by all the assets of the Company.  At the same time,  the Company
entered into  interest  rate swap  agreements  with the same bank at the time to
effectively  convert the foregoing  floating rate long-term  loans to fixed rate
loans.  Subsequently,  such  bank  sold  its  local  operations,  including  the
Company's  loans,  to another bank while  retaining the Company's  interest rate
swap agreements.  These agreements effectively fixed the Company's interest rate
on its  $2,512,000  mortgage  loan at 7.79%.  The interest  rate swap  agreement
matures in the same  amounts and over the same  periods as the related  mortgage
loan.

In October 1999, the Company entered into a $1.2 million mortgage loan agreement
with its bank to finance the expansion of its principal operating facility.  The
loan is payable in equal monthly  principal  installments  through January 2008,
with a $460,000  payment due at the end of the term.  The loan bears interest at
the bank's prime rate minus 160 basis points  (6.65% and 5.15% at September  30,
2006 and 2005,  respectively) or, at the Company's option,  LIBOR plus 100 basis
points (6.37% and 5.06% at September 30, 2006 and 2005, respectively).

In April 1997,  the Company's  Europe based  subsidiary  entered into a ten-year
500,000 pound sterling (approximately $935,000) bank term loan. The term loan is
payable in equal monthly  installments  with interest at a fixed rate of 9%. The
loan is secured by a first  mortgage on the  subsidiary's  property and contains
restrictive  covenants  that,  among other  things,  require the  subsidiary  to
maintain certain levels of net worth, earnings and debt service coverage.

Current and long-term  debt  maturing in each of the fiscal years  subsequent to
September 30, 2006 approximates $332,000 in 2007 and $1,740,000 in 2008.

weighted-average  period of 1.1 years.  The total  fair  value of shares  vested
during the years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $158,299,  $252,062
and $178,965, respectively.

NOTE 9.  Shareholder Rights Plan
- --------------------------------

On November 14, 2001,  the  Company's  Board of Directors  adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan,  which  declared a dividend of one Common Stock  Purchase  Right (a
Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company to shareholders
of record on December 21, 2001.  Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from
the Company one share of common stock at a purchase  price of $15 per share.  In
the event of the acquisition of or tender offer for 20% or more of the Company's
outstanding  common  stock by  certain  persons  or group  without  the Board of
Directors' consent,  such purchase price will be adjusted to equal fifty percent
of the average market price of the Company's common stock for a period of thirty
consecutive trading days immediately prior to the event. Until the Rights become
exercisable, they have no dilutive effect on the Company's earnings per share.

The Rights, which are non-voting and exercisable until November 30, 2011, can be
redeemed by the Company in whole at a price of $.001 per Right at any time prior
to the  acquisition by certain  persons or group of 50% of the Company's  common
stock.  Separate  certificates for the Rights will not be distributed,  nor will
the  Rights  be  exercisable,  until  either  (i) a  person  or  group  acquires
beneficial  ownership of 20% or more of the  Company's  common stock or (ii) the
tenth day after the  commencement  of a tender or exchange offer for 20% or more
of the Company's  common stock.  Following an  acquisition of 20% or more of the
Company's  common  shares,  each  Right  holder,  except  for  the  20% or  more
stockholder, can exercise their Right(s), unless the 20% or more stockholder has
offered to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company under terms that
a majority of the  independent  Directors of the Company have  determined  to be
fair and in the best  interest of the Company  and its  stockholders.  On May 7,
2002,  the  Company's  shareholders  approved  an  amendment  of  the  Company's
Certificate  of  Incorporation  to increase the total number of shares of common
stock authorized to issue from 10,000,000 to 25,000,000 shares.

In 2006, 2005 and 2004, 103,218, 148,645 and 238,717 shares, respectively,  have
been omitted from the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would have been
antidilutive.

NOTE 11.  Commitments and Contingencies
- ---------------------------------------

The Company leases  vehicles and occupies  certain  facilities  under  operating
leases that  expire at various  dates  through  2009.  The  leases,  which cover
periods  from three to eight  years,  generally  provide for renewal  options at
specified rental amounts.  The aggregate operating lease commitment at September
30,  2006 was  $517,000  with  minimum  rentals  for the fiscal  years  shown as
follows: 2007 - $379,000; 2008 - $119,000; and 2009 - $19,000.

The Company is a party to  employment  agreements  with  certain of its officers
that provide for, among other things,  the payment of compensation if there is a
change  in  control  without  Board of  Director  approval  (as  defined  in the
agreements). The contingent liability under such change in control provisions at
September  30, 2006 was  approximately  $2.0  million.  Certain of the Company's
employment  agreements  with its officers  provide for a severance  benefit upon
certain  occurrences or at a specified  date of  retirement,  absent a change in
control,  aggregating  $2.1  million  at  September  30,  2006.  The  Company is
amortizing  such obligation to expense on the  straight-line  method through the
specified dates of retirement.  Such expense amounted to  approximately  $93,000
and $289,000 in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company has  agreements  with  certain of its officers to provide a deferred
compensation  benefit in the form of 103,898  shares of common  stock  currently
held by the Company in  treasury.  Such shares vest upon  retirement  or, in the
case of 70,647 shares, the expiration of one officer's  employment  agreement in
September  2006.  All shares vest earlier  under certain  occurrences  including
death, involuntary termination or a change in control of the Company. The market
value of such shares approximated $630,000 at the dates of grant, which is being
amortized on the straight-line  method through the specified dates of retirement
or over the term of the employment agreement.

NOTE 12.  Litigation
- --------------------

The Company is one of several defendants in a patent infringement suit commenced
by Lectrolarm  Custom  Systems,  Inc. in May 2003 in the United States  District
Court for the Western  District of Tennessee.  The alleged  infringement  by the
Company  relates to its camera dome systems and other  products  that  represent
significant  sales to the Company.  Among other things,  the suit seeks past and
enhanced  damages,  injunctive  relief and attorney's fees. In January 2006, the
Company  received the plaintiff's  claim for past damages  through  December 31,
2005 that approximated $11.7 million plus pre-judgment interest. The Company and
its outside  patent  counsel  believe that the complaint  against the Company is
without merit.  The Company is vigorously  defending  itself and is a party to a
joint  defense with  certain  other named  defendants.  The Company is unable to
reasonably estimate a range of possible loss, if any, at this time. Although the
Company  believes that it has  meritorious  defenses to such claims,  there is a
possibility that an unfavorable outcome could ultimately occur that could result
in a liability  that is  material to the  Company's  results of  operations  and
financial  position.  The Company has held discussions with the plaintiff in the
interest of  settling  the case.  However,  there can be no  assurance  that any
settlement  can be reached.

                                     - 47 -

In  connection  with this  suit,  the  Company  petitioned  the U.S.  Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) for  reexamination of the plaintiff's  patent. In April
2006,  the  USPTO  issued  a  non-final  office  action  rejecting  all  of  the
plaintiff's  patent claims asserted  against the Company citing the existence of
prior art of the Company and another  defendant.  The plaintiff has appealed the
USPTO  ruling and has  additional  appeals  available  to them in the USPTO and,
thereafter,  in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  On June 30, 2006,
the Federal  District  Court  granted  the  defendants'  motion for  continuance
(delay) of the trial,  pending the outcome of the USPTO's  reexamination  office
proceedings.

In the normal course of business, the Company is a party to certain other claims
and  litigation.  Management  believes  that the  settlement  of such claims and
litigation, considered in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

NOTE 13.  Related Party Transactions
- ------------------------------------

As of September 30, 2006, CBC Co., Ltd. and affiliates ("CBC") owned
approximately 11.9% of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company,
which has been conducting business with CBC for approximately twenty-seven
years, imports certain finished products and components through CBC and also
sells its products to CBC. The Company purchased approximately $404,000,
$566,000 and $651,000 of products and components from CBC in fiscal years 2006,
2005, and 2004, respectively, and the Company sold $205,000, $362,000 and
$712,000 of products to CBC for distribution in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, the Company owed $11,000 and
$37,000, respectively, to CBC and CBC owed $5,000 and $32,000, respectively, to
the Company resulting from purchases of products.

Note 14:  Asset Purchase
- ------------------------

On October 1, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase all of the
operating  assets of Videotronic  Infosystems  GmbH  ("Videotronic"),  a Germany
based video system supplier which was operating under insolvency protection, for
700,000  Eurodollars  (approximately  $868,000).  The  purchase  was ratified by
Videotronic's  Creditors on November 26, 2004.  During the year ended  September
30, 2005, the Company  recognized a $211,000  extraordinary gain on the recovery
of Videotronic net assets in excess of their allocated purchase price. Such gain
includes  adjustments to assigned  values of accounts  receivable,  inventories,
trade payables and severance  liabilities.  Pro forma results of operations have
not been presented due to the relative  insignificance  of the operating  assets
acquired.

Note 15:  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
- ------------------------------------------

In July 2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes --
an  interpretation  of FASB  Statement No. 109". FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for  uncertainty  in  income  taxes  recognized  in  an  enterprise's  financial
statements in accordance  with FASB  Statement  No. 109,  Accounting  for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition  threshold and measurement  attribute for
the financial  statement  recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected  to be  taken  in a tax  return.  FIN  48  also  provides  guidance  on
derecognition,  classification,  interest and  penalties,  accounting in interim
periods,  disclosures,  and  transition.  FIN 48 is  effective  for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption
of FIN 48 will have a material impact on its  consolidated  financial  position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In  September  2006,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  157,  "Fair Value  Measurements"
("SFAS  157").  SFAS 157  clarifies  that fair value is the amount that would be
exchanged  to sell an asset or  transfer a liability  in an orderly  transaction
between market  participants.  Further, the standard establishes a framework for
measuring  fair value in generally  accepted  accounting  principles and expands
certain  disclosures  about fair value  measurements.  SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not expect that
the  adoption  of SFAS 157  will  have a  material  impact  on its  consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

                                     - 48 -

In September  2006,  the U.S.  Securities and Exchange  Commission  issued Staff
Accounting   Bulletin   No.  108,   "Considering   the  Effects  of  Prior  Year
Misstatements   when   Quantifying   Misstatements  in  Current  Year  Financial
Statements"  ("SAB  108").  SAB 108  provides  interpretive  guidance on how the
effects of the  carryover  or  reversal  of prior year  misstatements  should be
considered in  quantifying a current year  misstatement.  The SEC staff believes
that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income
statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a
misstatement  that, when all relevant  quantitative and qualitative  factors are
considered,  is material.  SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2006. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SAB 108 will
have a  material  impact on its  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows.

EXHIBIT 10.24

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

          disability,  401(k) or other benefit plans as may from time to time be
          made available to the Officers of the Company,  subject to the general
          eligibility requirements and provisions of such plans.

4.  Covenant  not to Compete.  McGOWAN  agrees that during the term of
     this  Agreement or any  replacement  Agreement  and for a period of two (2)
     years  thereafter,   or  at  anytime  McGowan  is  receiving  Severance  or
     Retirement  payments  under  Section 5 herein,  he shall  not  directly  or
     indirectly  within  the  United  States or Europe  engage  in, or enter the
     employment  of or render any services to any other  entity  engaged in, any
     business  of a  similar  nature  to or in  competition  with the  Company's
     business  of  designing,  manufacturing  and  selling  video  security  and
     surveillance equipment and protection devices anywhere in the United States
     and Europe.  McGOWAN further  acknowledges that the services to be rendered
     under this  Agreement  by him are  special,  unique,  and of  extraordinary
     character and that a material  breach by him of this section will cause the
     Company to suffer  irreparable  damage; and McGOWAN agrees that in addition
     to any other  remedy,  this  section  shall be  enforceable  by negative or
     affirmative  preliminary or permanent  injunction in any Court of competent
     jurisdiction.  McGOWAN  acknowledges that he may only be released from this
     covenant if the Company  materially  breach's this Agreement or provides to
     him a written  release of this  provision.  This clause  shall  survive the
     expiration or termination of this Agreement.

          5. Severance/Retirement Payment on Certain Terminations or Events.

               A. If either McGOWAN retires (anytime after attaining the minimum
          retirement age of 60) or the Company terminates  McGOWAN's  employment
          with the Company for reasons  other than  "Misconduct";  or dies while
          still a full time employee, or is terminated under paragraph 7 herein,
          then McGOWAN,  or his survivor shall be entitled to receive  severance
          or retirement  payments as the case may be, without  reduction for any
          offset or mitigation,  in an amount equal to $290,000.  This Section 5
          shall survive the  expiration  of this  Agreement.  If this  Agreement
          expires and McGOWAN is  required  to perform his  services  outside of
          Long  Island or is  required  to take any base  salary,  benefits,  or
          perquisites   (customarily   provided)   reduction,   then   McGOWAN's
          employment shall be deemed to have been  effectively  terminated under
          this Section 5.

               B.  "Misconduct"  shall  mean (a) a  refusal  or  negligence,  or
          inability,  due to drug  or  alcohol  impairment  or  indifference  to
          perform (in  performing) the duties and  responsibilities  required of
          his position;  (b) fraud,  misappropriation or embezzlement  involving
          the Company or its assets;  or (c)  conviction  of a felony  involving
          moral  turpitude;  or (d) a violation of the Company's  Code of Ethics
          and Conduct.
 
               C. In the event of payment  of  severance  under this  Section 5,
          such payments shall be in lieu of any other  obligation by the Company
          for  accrued   compensation  benefit  of  any  kind  at  the  time  of
          termination.  Post  termination  stock option  exercises in accordance
          with Plan provisions are excepted.

               D. The severance  amount shall be paid in equal monthly  payments
          over a 24-month period. Should McGOWAN be in violation of Paragraph 4,
          severance payments shall cease at that time.

          6. Termination Payment on Change of Control.

               A.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement,  if a
          "Change  of  Control"  occurs  without  the  consent  of the  Board of
          Directors,  McGOWAN,  at his option, may elect to terminate his rights
          and  obligations  under this  Agreement  and to receive a  termination
          payment, without reduction for any offset or mitigation,  in an amount
          equal to three times his average annual base salary for the five years
          preceding the Change of Control,  in either  present value lump sum or
          extended payments over three years as McGOWAN shall elect.

               B. A "Change of Control"  shall be deemed to have occurred if any
          entity or person  shall  directly  or  indirectly  acquire  beneficial
          ownership  of 50% or more of the then  outstanding  shares of  capital
          stock of the Company.

               C. McGOWAN's  option to elect to terminate his obligations and to
          receive a  termination  payment as either a present  value lump sum or
          extended payments may be exercised only by written notice delivered to
          the  Company  within  90 days  following  the  date on  which  McGOWAN
          receives  actual  notice of a Change of  Control.  In  selecting  this
          option  the  Company  shall  have no  obligation  to  McGowan  for any
          severance payments under paragraph 5.

7. Death or  Disability.  The Company may terminate this Agreement and
     cease all salary and benefits due  thereunder,  (excluding  liability under
     Section 5) at its sole option and determination, if during the term of this
     Agreement (a) McGOWAN dies or (b) McGOWAN  becomes so disabled for a period
     of six months that he is  substantially  unable to perform his duties under
     this Agreement for such period. The Company shall be the sole judge of such
     disability.

          8.  Arbitration.  Any controversy or claim arising out of, or relating
     to this Agreement,  or the breach thereof,  shall be settled by arbitration
     in the  City of New York in  accordance  with  the  rules  of the  American
     Arbitration  Association  then in  effect,  and  judgement  upon the  award
     rendered be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

          9. Miscellaneous.

               A. This  Agreement  contains  the entire  agreement  between  the
          parties and supersedes all prior agreements by the parties relating to
          payments by the Company upon involuntary  employment  termination with
          or without  cause,  however,  it does not restrict or limit such other
          benefits  as the CEO may  determine  to provide or make  available  to
          McGOWAN.

               B.  This  Agreement  may  not be  waived,  changed,  modified  or
          discharged  orally,  but only by agreement  in writing,  signed by the
          party against whom enforcement of any waiver, change, modification, or
          discharge is sought.

               C. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of New York State
          applicable to contracts  between New York State residents and made and
          to be principally performed in New York State.

               D. If any part of this Agreement is held to be  unenforceable  by
          any court of competent jurisdiction,  the remaining provisions of this
          Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

E. This  Agreement  shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding
          upon, the Company, its successor, and assigns.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement.
